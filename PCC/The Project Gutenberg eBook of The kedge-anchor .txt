PREFACE.

In offering the following work to the public, the author deems no
apology necessary, as it was written for the use of the Naval and
Merchant Service of the United States, as a ready means of introducing
Young Sailors to the theory of that art by which they must expect
to advance in the profession they have chosen. He flatters himself,
however, that it will be found useful to many old and experienced
seamen, as well as to those who have just entered the sailors’ life,
and particularly to those destined for the Navy. Should it fall into
the hands of the learned, they will bear in mind that he is better
versed with the marlinespike than the pen, and that it was composed in
the hours of relaxation from official duties. He therefore hopes that
it may be received for that which it is intended to be, A KEDGE-ANCHOR,
for the youthful sailor. The work has been submitted to the inspection
of a number of experienced officers, both in the Navy and Merchant
Service, who have given it their decided approbation;--some of whose
names are appended to the work. With these few remarks, he submits it
to a discerning public, to stand or fall on its own merits.

THE KEDGE-ANCHOR.

PART I.

_We shall first commence with knotting a rope-yarn._

=1.=--TO KNOT ROPE-YARNS.

Take the two ends of the yarns, and split them open about two inches
from the end; and if to make a smooth knot, you may scrape down a
little with a knife, so as to make the ends lay smooth; you then
crutch them together as you see in Plate No. 1. Take two opposite ends
(leaving the other two dormant), pass one of the ends _under_, and the
other _over_ the standing part of the yarn, connecting them together at
the same side you took them from at first; then jam your knot taut, and
see if it will stand test by stretching the yarn from knee to knee, and
hauling on it; if it stands without drawing, you may trim the ends, and
go on.

=2.=--TO MAKE A FOX.

Take two or three rope-yarns and make them fast to a belaying-pin;
stretch them out taut, and twist them together on your knee; then rub
it down smooth with a piece of old tarred parcelling. This is called
a Fox, and is used for many purposes, such as making gaskets, mats,
plats, temporary seizings, bending studding-sails, &c.

=3.=--TO MAKE A SPANISH FOX.

Take a single rope-yarn and make one end fast as before to a
belaying-pin, and untwist and twist it up again the contrary way, and
rub it smooth. This is used for small seizings, &c.

=4.=--TO MAKE A KNITTLE.

A Knittle is made of two or three rope-yarns laid up together by hand,
twisting them between the thumb and finger, and laying them up against
the twist of the yarn. They are used for many purposes on board a ship,
particularly for hammock clews.

=5.=--OVERHANDED KNOT.

To make an overhanded knot, you pass the end of the rope over the
standing part and through the bight.

=6.=--FIGURE OF EIGHT KNOTS.

Take the end of your rope round the standing part, under its own part
and through the lower bight, and your knot is made.

=7.=--TWO HALF-HITCHES.

Pass the end of your rope round the standing part, and bring it up
through the bight--this is one half-hitch; two of these, one above the
other, completes it.

=8.=--REEF, OR SQUARE KNOT.

First make an overhanded knot round a yard, spar, or anything you
please; then bring the end being next to you over the left hand and
through the bight; haul both ends taut, and it is made.

=9.=--A BOWLINE KNOT.

Take the end of the rope in your right hand, and the standing part in
the left--lay the end over the standing part, then with your left hand
turn the bight of the standing part over the end part, so as to form
a cuckold’s neck on the standing part; then lead the end through the
standing part _above_, and stick it down through the cuckold’s neck,
and it will appear as in the Plate.

=10.=--BOWLINE ON THE BIGHT.

Take the bight of the rope in your right hand, and the standing part
in the other; throw a cuckold’s neck over the bight with the standing
parts, then haul enough of the bight up through the cuckold’s neck to
go under and over all parts; jam all taut, and it will appear as in the
Plate.

=11.=--A RUNNING BOWLINE.

Take the end of the rope round the standing part, through the bight,
and make a single bowline upon the running part, and the knot is made.

=12.=--A TIMBER HITCH.

Take the end of a rope round a spar; pass it under and over the
standing part then pass several turns round its own part and it is done.

=13.=--A FISHERMAN’S BEND.

With the end of a rope take two round turns round a spar, or through
the ring of a kedge-anchor; take one half hitch around the standing
parts, and under all parts of the turns; then one half hitch around the
standing part above all, and stop the end to the standing part; or you
can dispense with the last half hitch, and tuck the end under one of
the round turns, and it becomes a studding-sail bend.

=14.=--A ROLLING BEND.

A rolling bend is something similar to a fisherman’s bend. It is two
round turns round a spar as you see in the plate, two half hitches
around the standing part, and the end stopped back.--(_See Plate._)

=15.=--A CARRICK BEND.

This bend is more used in bending hawsers together than for any other
purpose. In forming this bend you will take the end of the hawser, and
form a bight, by laying the end part on the top of the standing part,
so as to form a cross; take the end of the other hawser, and reeve it
down through this bight, up and over this cross; then pass the end down
through the bight again on the opposite side, from the other end, for
one end must be on the top, and the other underneath, as you see in the
plate.

If both end parts come out at the top it will be a granny’s knot.
(_Remember this._)

=16.=--A CAT’S-PAW.

This is generally used in the ends of lanyards, to hook the tackle to,
in setting up rigging; to form it, you first lay the end part of the
lanyard across the standing part, which will form a bight; then lay
hold of the bight with one hand on each side of it, breaking it down,
and turning it over _from you_ two or three times; clap both bights
together, and hook on to both parts.--(_See Plate._)

=17.=--A SHEET OR BECKET BEND.

Pass the end of a rope through the bight of another rope, or through
the becket of a block; then round both parts of the bight, or becket,
and take the end under its own part, as you see in the plate. It is
sometimes put under twice, and the end stopped back to the standing
part.

=18.=--A BLACK-WALL HITCH.

This is used with a lanyard, in setting up rigging, to hook a luff
tackle to, instead of a cat’s paw, where the end of the lanyard is not
long enough to form a paw; but a strap and toggle is preferable to both.

To make a black-wall over a hook, you form a bight, or rather a _kink_
with the end of the lanyard, having the end part underneath, and the
standing part on the top; stick the hook through the bight, keeping the
bight well up on the back of the hook (as you see in the plate), until
you set taut the tackle.

_Note._--You can learn it much better by practice than explanation.

=19.=--A ROLLING HITCH.

With the end of a rope take a half-hitch around the standing part; then
take another through the same bight, jaming it in above the first hitch
and the upper part of the bight, then haul it taut, and dog your end
above the hitch, around the standing part, or you may take a half-hitch
around the standing part and stop the end back with a yarn.

=20.=--A SALVAGEE STRAP.

To make a salvagee strap, you may get a couple of spike nails, and
drive them into an old piece of plank, or whatever you can find
convenient to answer the purpose, or get two hooks, lash them to any
convenient place, as far apart as the length you intend to make the
strap; take the end of the ball of rope-yarns, and make it fast to one
of the spikes or hooks, then take it round the other one, and keep
passing the rope-yarn round and round in this manner, hauling every
turn taut as you pass it, until it is as stout as you wish it to be.

If it is to be a very large strap, marl it down with stout spun-yarn;
if of middling size, marl with two single rope-yarns; if a small strap,
a single rope-yarn.

=21.=--A PUDDING FOR A MAST OR YARD.

Take a piece of rope of the required length, and splice an eye in each
end; get it on a stretch, worm it, and then parcel it according to the
shape you want it. They are generally made as you see in the Plate,
large in the middle, tapering gradually toward the ends, and made flat
on the side that goes next the yard or mast. When you have got it the
size required, marl it down, commencing in the middle and marling both
ways until you come to the eye; if it is intended for a yard it is
generally covered with thick leather or green hide; if for a mast, it
is pointed over for neatness.

=22.=--A SHORT SPLICE.

To splice the two ends of a rope together, you first unlay the rope
to a sufficient length, then crutch them together as you see in the
plate; you must then lay hold of the three strands next to you in your
left hand, holding them solid around the other part until you stick
the three upper ends, or, if it is a large rope, you may stop the
ends with a yarn; then take the upper or middle end, pass it over the
first strand next to it, stick it underneath the second strand, and
haul it taut in the lay of the rope; turn the rope a little towards
you, and stick the second end as you did the first; the third in the
same manner, hauling them taut along the lay of the rope;--turn the
rope round, stick the other three ends in the same manner, and it will
appear as in the plate.

_Note_.--If you intend to serve over the ends, you need not stick
them but once; but if not you must stick them twice, and cross-whip
them across the strands so as to make them more secure. If the ends
are to be served, take a few of the underneath yarns, enough to fill
up the lay of the rope for worming, then scrape or trim the outside
ends, and marl them down ready for serving.

=23.=--A LONG SPLICE.

To make a long splice, unlay the ends of two ropes to a sufficient
length, crutch them together in the same manner as a short splice;
unlay one strand for a considerable length, and fill up the space which
it leaves with the opposite strand next to it; then turn the rope round
and lay hold of the two next strands that will come opposite their
respective lays, unlay one and fill up with the other as before; then
cut off the long strands, and it will appear as in the Plate.

To complete this splice, you will split the strands equally in two,
then take the two opposite half strands and knot them together, so
as to fill up the vacant lay; then you stick the ends twice under
two strands with all six of the half strands, leaving the other six
neutral; then stretch the splice well before you cut the ends off, and
it is finished.

=24.=--EYE-SPLICE.

An eye-splice is made by opening the end of a rope, and laying the
strands at any distance upon the standing part of the rope, according
to the size of the eye-splice you intend to make; you then divide
your strands by putting one strand on the top and one underneath the
standing part, then take the middle strand, (having previously opened
the lay with a marlinespike,) and stick it under its respective strand,
as you see in the Plate. Your next end is taken over the first strand
and under the second; the third and last end is taken through the third
strand on the other side.

=25.=--A CUT SPLICE.

Cut a rope in two, and according to the size you intend to make the
splice or collar--lay the end of one rope on the standing part of the
other, and stick the end through between the strands, in the same
manner as an eye-splice, and it will appear as in the plate. This forms
a collar in the bight of a rope, and is used for pendants, jib-guys,
breast-backstays, odd shrouds, &c.

=26.=--A FLEMISH EYE.

Unlay the end of a rope, open the strands and separate every yarn,
divide them in two halves, then take a piece of round wood the size
you intend to make the eye, and half-knot about one-half of the
inside yarns over the piece of wood; scrape the remainder down over
the others; marl, parcel, and serve, or if preferable, hitch it with
hambro-line. This makes a snug eye for the collars of stays. (_See
Plate._)

=27.=--AN ARTIFICIAL EYE.

Take the end of a rope and unlay one strand to a certain distance, and
form the eye by placing the two strands along the standing part of the
rope and stopping them fast to it; then take the odd strand and cross
it over the standing part, and lay it into the vacant place you took
it from at first; work around the eye, filling up the vacant strand
until it comes out at the crutch again, and lies under the other two
strands; the ends are tapered, scraped down, marled, and served over
with spun-yarn.

=28.=--TO WORM AND SERVE A ROPE.

Worming a rope, is to fill up the vacant space between the strands of
the rope with spun-yarn; this is done in order to strengthen it, and to
render the surface smooth and round for parceling.

Parceling a rope is wrapping old canvass round it, cut in strips from
two to three inches wide, according to the size of the rope; the strips
of canvass to be well tarred and rolled up in rolls before you commence
to lay it on the rope. The service is of spun-yarn, clapped on by a
wooden mallet such as you see in the plate, called a serving mallet;
it has a large score cut in the under part of it, so as to fay on the
rope, and a handle about a foot long, or according to the size of the
mallet. The service is always laid on against the lay of the rope; a
boy passes the ball of spun-yarn at some distance from the man that is
serving the rope, and passes it round as he turns the mallet; when the
required length of service is put on, the end is put under the three or
four last turns of the service and hauled taut.

_Note._--It has always been customary to put on parceling with the
lay of the rope in all cases; but rigging that you do not intend to
serve over, the parceling ought to be put on the contrary way.

=29.=--TO CLAP ON A THROAT AND QUARTER SEIZING.

Splice an eye in one end of the seizing, and take the other end round
both parts of the rope that the seizing is to be put on; then reeve it
through the eye, pass a couple of turns and heave them hand-taut; then
make a _marlinespike-hitch_ on the seizing, by taking a turn with the
seizing over the marlinespike, and laying the end over the standing
part; push the marlinespike down through, then under the standing part
and up through the bight again. Heave taut the two turns of the seizing
with the spike; pass the rest and heave them taut in the same manner,
making six, eight, or ten turns, according to the size of the rope;
then pass the end through the last turn, and pass the riding turns,
five, seven, or nine, always laying one less of the riding than of the
first turns; these should not be hove too taut--the end is now passed
up through the seizing, and two cross-turns taken between the two parts
of the rope, and round the seizing; take the end under the last turn
and heave it taut; make an overhanded knot on the end of the seizing,
and cut off close to the knot.

_Note._--When this is put on the end of a rope, and round the
standing part, it is called an end-seizing; if on the two parts below
the end, a middle or quarter-seizing. A throat-seizing is passed the
same way, but is not crossed with the end of the seizing.

=30.=--TO MAKE A TURK’S HEAD.

Turk’s heads are made on man-ropes, and sometimes on the foot-ropes
of jib-booms in place of an overhanded knot, as the Turk’s head is
much neater than the knot, and considered by some an ornament. It is
generally made of small white line. Take a round turn round the rope
you intend to make the Turk’s head on,--cross the bights on each side
of the round turn, and stick one end under one cross, and the other
under the other cross; it will then be formed like the middle figure in
the plate, after which follow the lead until it shows three parts all
round, and it is completed.

=31.=--TO SHEEPSHANK A ROPE OR BACKSTAY.

This is intended for shortening a backstay; the rope is doubled in
three parts, as you see in the Plate, and a hitch taken over each bight
with the standing part of the backstay and jamed taut.

=32.=--TO PUT A STRAND IN A ROPE.

This is done in case of one strand of a rope getting chafed or magged,
and the other two remaining good. To perform this, you take your knife
and cut the strand at the place where it is chafed, and unlay it about
a couple of feet each way; then take a strand of a rope as near the
size as possible, and lay it in the vacancy of the rope, (as you see in
the Plate,) and stick the ends the same as a long splice.

=33.=--TO WALL AND CROWN.

Unlay the end of a rope, and with the three strands form a wall knot,
by taking the first strand and forming a bight; take the next strand,
and bring it round the end of the first, the third strand round the
second, and up through the bight of the first--this is a wall. (_See
Plate._)

To crown this, lay one end over the top of the knot, which call the
first, then lay the second over it, the third over the second, and
through the bight of the first. It will then appear as you see in Plate
No. 2.

=34.=--TO MAKE A MATHEW WALKER.

A Mathew Walker is made by opening the end of a rope, and taking the
first strand round the rope and through its own bight; then take the
second end round the rope underneath, through the bight of the first,
and through its own bight; the third end take round the same way,
underneath and through the bights of all three. Haul the ends well
taut, and it will appear as in the Plate. This is a good lanyard knot,
if well made.

=35.=--A SPRITSAIL SHEET KNOT.

Unlay two ends of a rope, and place the two parts which are unlaid
together; form a bight with one strand, and wall the six together
against the lay of the rope, (which is hawser-laid,) the same as you
would a single wall with three ends; after you have walled with the six
ends, haul them taut; you must then crown with the six ends, and it
will appear as in the Plate. To complete it, you must follow the lead
of the parts, and double wall and crown it.

This knot is frequently used in old-fashioned ships as a stopper knot.

=36.=--A SHROUD KNOT.

Unlay the ends of two ropes and place them one within the other, the
same as you commence to make a short splice; then single wall the ends
of one rope round the standing part of the other, and then wall the
other three ends in the same manner; the ends are opened out, tapered
down, and served over with spun-yarn. This knot is used when a shroud
is either shot or carried away.

=37.=--A FRENCH SHROUD KNOT.

Place the ends of two ropes as before, drawing them close together;
then lay the first three ends back upon their own part, and single
wall the other three ends round the bights of the other three and the
standing part; it will then appear like the figure in the Plate. The
ends are tapered as the other. This knot is much neater than the common
shroud knot.

=38.=--SINGLE DIAMOND KNOT.

Unlay the end of a rope a sufficient length to make the knot, and with
the three strands form three bights, holding the ends fast down the
side of the rope in your left hand, with the standing part of the rope;
then take the first strand over the bight of the second strand and
through the bight of the third; then take the second over the third
and through the bight of the first; then the third, over the first and
through the second. Haul these taut and lay the ends of the strands
up again, and it will appear as in the Plate. This knot is used for
jib-boom foot-ropes, man-ropes, &c.

=39.=--DOUBLE DIAMOND KNOT.

To make this, you make a single one as before; then take a marlinespike
and open the strands, and follow the lead through two single bights,
the ends coming out at the top of the knot; lay the ends of the strands
up as before, and it will appear as in the Plate.

=40.=--A STOPPER KNOT

Is made by double-walling and crowning, which has been described before
on another page. The ends, if very short, are whipped without being
laid up; but if long they are laid up and stopped.

=41.=--A BUOY-ROPE KNOT.

Unlay the strands of a cable-laid rope, take one strand out of the
large ones, and then lay the three large ones up again as before; take
the three small ones which were left out, single and double them round
the standing part of the rope; then take your spare ends, worm them
along the lay and stop them.

=42.=--COMMON SENNIT.

Sennit is made by plaiting rope-yarns together. (_See Plate No. 3._)

=43.=--A SEA GASKET.

A sea gasket is made by taking three or four foxes, according to the
size you intend to make the gasket. Middle them over a belaying-pin,
and plait three or four together, long enough to make the eye; then
clasp both parts together to form the eye; then plait it by bringing
the outside foxes on each side alternately over to the middle; the
outside one is laid with the right hand, and the remainder held
steadily--work the whole together, adding a fox when necessary. When
you have got it a sufficient length, diminish by dropping a fox at
proper intervals. To finish it, you must lay one end up, leaving its
bight down; then plait the others through this bight about one inch;
haul the bight taut to secure all parts--cut the ends off, whip it, and
it is completed.

=44.=--A PANCH, OR WROUGHT MAT.

A piece of six or nine-thread stuff is stretched in a horizontal
direction, and the foxes (according to the breadth you intend to make
the mat) are middled and hung over it; then take the fox nearest the
left hand and twist a turn in the two parts, and one part give to the
man opposite (two men being employed to work the mat); the next fox
has a turn twisted in its two parts, and one part given back to your
partner; the remainder are twisted round the first which are given
back, and then again round its own part, and so on with the remainder
of the foxes, until you get it the breadth you wish. At the bottom of
the mat selvedge it by taking a piece of nine-thread stuff, the same
as you used for the top. The two parts of the foxes which are twisted
together at the bottom are divided, and the nine-thread put between
them; the foxes are hitched round it, and the end put through its own
lay with a marlinespike; trim the ends off, and thrum it with pieces
of old strands of rope, cut in pieces about three or four inches long;
open the lays of the foxes with a marlinespike, push the thrums through
the lays, and open the ends out.

=45.=--HARBOR GASKET, OR FRENCH SENNIT.

A harbor gasket is made with foxes, something similar to the common sea
gasket,--but instead of taking the outside fox over all the rest, and
bringing it into the middle, you interweave it between them by taking
the outside fox of both sides, and taking it over one and under the
other, working it towards the middle, the same as common sennit.

=46.=--POINTING A ROPE.

Unlay the end of the rope a sufficient length for pointing, and stop
it; open the strands out into yarns, and take out as many as you think
it will require to make the knittles, by splitting the yarns and making
one knittle out of every outside yarn; when they are made, stop them
back on the standing part of the rope; then form the point with the
rest of the yarns, by trimming and scraping them down to a proper size,
and marl it down with twine--divide the knittles, taking every other
one up and every other one down; then take a piece of twine, called
the warp, and with it pass these turns very taut, taking a hitch with
the last turn every time you pass the warp, or filling. Then take the
knittles which are up and bring them down, and the ones which are down,
up; hauling them taut, and passing the warp every time over the lower
knittles; proceed in this manner until you get almost to the end,
reserving enough of the knittles to finish it with; leave out every
other bight of the knittles of the last lay, and pass the warp through
the bight, haul them taut and cut them off. A becket is sometimes
worked in the end.

_Note._--Knittles are made by laying rope-yarns together, with your
finger and thumb, against the twist of the yarn.

Snaking is for the better securing of a seizing, which is passed
round the single part of the rope and therefore cannot be crossed. It
is done by tucking the end part of the seizing _under_ and _over_ the
lower and upper turns of the seizing.

=47.=--TO MAKE A GROMMET.

A grommet is made by unlaying a strand of a rope and placing one part
over the other; with the long end follow the lay, until it forms a
ring, with three parts of the strand all round; finish it by knotting
and sticking the ends the same as a long splice. (_See plate No. 3._)

=48.=--TO PASS A ROSE LASHING.

It is used in lashing a strap or pudding round a mast or yard or the
parral lashing of a top-gallant yard; this lashing is passed crossways
over and under one eye, then under and over the other; the end part is
afterwards taken in a circular form round the crossing, and the end
tucked under the last part.

_Note._--This circular part is done to expend the end, instead of
cutting it off, so that it will answer again for the same purpose.

=49.=--TO WEAVE A SWORD MAT.

A piece of wood called a sword is used; this is put alternately between
the parts of the spun-yarn or sennit, stretched over two round iron
bolts (as you see in the figure); the warp of marline is placed through
the parts which the sword has opened, and jamed by it close to the
head; a piece of spun-yarn is put slack through the same division at
the opposite end and left there; the sword is taken out, passed under
and over the parts as before, and each end of the warp passed and
jamed taut. The piece of spun-yarn which was left at the opposite end,
is now lifted up, and brings the parts as they were first divided by
the sword; the warp is passed as before, and so on until the mat is
completed.

=50.=--A LASHING CLEAT

Is shaped like the figure in the Plate, having scores for the seizings
which are marked, and a groove cut in the part that fits next to the
shroud.

BLOCKS.

=51.=--A SHELL, PIN, AND SHEAVE.

Blocks are of different kinds, shapes, and sizes, according to the
several purposes for which they are intended.

A block consists of a shell, sheave, and pin; and from the number of
these sheaves it derives its name, viz.: a block with one sheave is
called single; with two sheaves, double; with three, treble; and with
four sheaves it is called a four-fold block. The shell of a block is
made of ash, and has one or two scores cut at each end, according to
its size; these scores are for the purpose of admitting a strap, which
goes round the block, in the centre of which is a hole for the pin;
the shell is hollow inside to admit the sheave. The sheave is a solid
wheel, made of lignum vitæ, iron, or brass; in the centre is a hole for
the pin, on which it turns. The lignum vitæ sheave is bushed with brass
or iron; round the circumference a groove is cut, that the rope which
goes over it may play with ease. The sheave is placed in the shell, and
the pin is put through both shell and sheave, which constitute a block.

=52.=--SINGLE, DOUBLE, AND TREBLE BLOCKS.

What is termed a single block has but one sheave, and if intended for a
double strap there are two scores on the outside of the shell. Single
blocks are more used than any other kind on board of a ship.

_A double block_ has an additional sheave; it is otherwise the same as
a single block.

_A treble block_ is made in the same manner as a double, with one
more sheave. Treble blocks are generally used as purchase blocks, and
strapped in the manner you see in the Plate.

=53.=--A SHOULDER BLOCK.

A shoulder block is the same as a single block, with the exception that
it has a projection at the bottom of the shell, called a shoulder, to
prevent the rope that reeves through it from jaming between the block
and the yard. These blocks are mostly used for bumkin or lift blocks on
lower vards.

=54.=--A FIDDLE BLOCK

Is made like two single blocks one above the other, the upper one being
the largest so as to allow the rope which is rove in the upper sheave,
to play clear of the rope in the under one. These blocks are used in
places where there is not space enough for a double one, or where it
(the double block) would be liable to split by not _canting_ fair, or
having room to play. These blocks are used for top burtons, &c. &c.

=55.=--A SHOE BLOCK

Is also made like two single blocks, but the sheave of the upper
one lies in a contrary direction to that of the lower one. They are
generally used as buntline blocks to courses; the buntline reeving in
the upper sheave, and the whip in the lower one.

=56.=--A SISTER BLOCK

Has two sheave-holes one above the other,--three scores for seizings,
one at each end, and one between both sheaves; they are hollowed out
on each side of the shell, to take the shroud. These blocks are used
as topsail-lift and reef-tackle blocks, and are seized-in between the
two forward shrouds of the topmast rigging, above the futtock stave.
The lift reeves through the lower sheave, and the topsail reef-tackle
through the upper one.

=57.=--A DEAD-EYE

Is a large round piece of wood with three holes in it, (as you see in
the Plate,) and a groove cut round it for the shroud to lie in. It is
used to turn in the ends of shrouds and backstays;--the three holes
are used to reeve the lanyard through, when setting up the shroud or
backstay.

A bull’s-eye is a kind of thick wooden thimble, with a hole in the
centre, and a groove cut round the outside for the rope or seizing to
lay in.

=58.=--A HEART

Is a block of wood with a large hole in the centre, at the bottom
of which are four or five scores, and round the outside is a groove
cut to admit a rope called a stay; there are other hearts called
collar-hearts, which are open at the lower ends, opposite to which
the lanyard is passed. This heart has a double score cut round the
outside, and two grooves cut on each side for the seizings to lay in,
which keeps the collar in the scores of the heart. Hearts intended for
bobstays should be made of lignum vitæ; those made of ash being liable
to split.

=59.=--A BELAYING-PIN RACK

Is a piece of wood with a number of holes through it, in which
belaying-pins are stuck; on the back part are several scores for the
shrouds to lie in to which it is seized.

=60.=--A EUPHROE

Is a long piece of wood, having a number of holes, through which the
legs of the crowfoot is rove,--a score is cut round it to admit of a
strap. This is used for the ridge of an awning.

=61.=--A HORN CLEAT.

Horn cleats are used for different purposes; some are made to seize on
to the shrouds; they are called _lashing cleats_; others are made to
nail on to different parts of the bulwarks. They are of different shape
and size, and used to belay various ropes to, in all parts of the ship.

=62.=--A B-CLEAT

Is a piece of wood scored out inside, something like the letter B, and
rounded off outside; they are used for leading a rope through, or for
keeping it in its place on the masts, bowsprit, &c.

=63.=--A STRAP FOR A BLOCK.

Straps are fitted in various ways, according to the use they are
intended for, and according to the size of the block.

A common strap is fitted in the following manner:--

First, cut the rope once-and-a-half the round of the block, then get it
on a stretch,--worm, parcel, and serve as near the end as possible, not
to interfere with splicing; then splice the ends together with a short
splice, and finish serving snug up to the splice. Stretch it and cut
the ends off, or you may serve over the ends, and it will appear as in
the Plate. If there is a number of those straps required, it would be
best to get the rope on a stretch, and serve off the required number
before cutting.

=64.=--A TAIL BLOCK

Is strapped with an eye-splice, snug round the block; the ends are
stuck but once; then scraped down, and served over with spun-yarn. Clap
on a stout whipping about six inches from the splice; open the ends
out, twist them into foxes, and plait them together, as mentioned for
gaskets; or, the strands may be opened out and marled down salvagee
fashion; tapering it a little towards the end of the tail.

_Note._--Blocks used for jiggers, have a double tail made in the same
manner.

=65.=--A PURCHASE BLOCK

Is double strapped, having two scores in the shell for that purpose;
the strap is wormed, parceled, and served, (sometimes only wormed and
parceled,) and spliced together. It is then doubled so as to bring
the splice at the bottom of the block. The seizing is put on the same
as any other; the only difference is, that it is crossed both ways,
through the double parts of the strap.

These block-straps are so large and stiff, that it requires a purchase
to set them securely in the scores of the block, and bring them into
their proper place.

=66.=--A TOP BLOCK

Is a single iron-bound hook-block, with (generally) a brass sheave; it
hooks to an eye-bolt in the cap. The top-pendants are rove through the
top-blocks when swaying up topmasts.

=67.=--A CAT BLOCK.

The cat block is three-fold, iron-bound, with a large iron hook
attached to it, for the purpose of hooking the ring of the anchor when
catting it.

On the forward side of the shell of this block are two small eye-bolts,
for the purpose of fitting a small rope, called the back-rope bridle,
used in hooking the cat.

=68.=--A SNATCH BLOCK

Is generally iron-bound, with a swivel hook; an iron clasp is fitted
on the iron band, or strap, with a hinge to go over the snatch, and
toggles on the opposite side, as you see in the Plate. The bight of a
hawser or large rope is placed in this block, when warping the ship, &c.

_Note._--There has been of late years several different improvements
made on these blocks.

Blocks of this description, and of a large size, are generally termed
“viol, or rouse-about blocks.”

=69.=--A NUN BUOY.

Buoys are used when a ship is riding at anchor, to denote the position
of the anchor. They are a kind of a cask, large in the middle, and
small at both ends; hooped close with iron hoops, and strapped with
rope well served. A buoy-strap is cut _nine times_ the length of the
buoy; this is sufficient to make the slings and hoops; the slings have
an eye spliced in each end, the hoops are rove through these eyes,
spliced together, and fitted on the buoy, as you see in the Plate.

=70.=--TO BEND A BUOY-ROPE.

The buoy rope is made fast with a clove-hitch round the arms of the
anchor, close up to the crown, and the end part stopped along the
shank, with one or two stops.

Some are fitted with a running eye, and when used this way the running
eye is rove round one arm, a hitch taken over the other, and seized in
the cross.

In large ships they are fitted with pendants and slip buoy-ropes; the
pendants have a large thimble spliced in one end, large enough to
receive a stout hawser, in case you should want to purchase the anchor
by the buoy-rope. The size for the slip buoy-rope is one-third the size
of the proper buoy-rope.

=71.=--TO PUDDING THE RING OF AN ANCHOR.

The ring of the anchor is well tarred, and parceled with tarred
canvass; then a number of lengths of old rope are cut three times the
diameter of the ring; these are laid on the ring, and stopped by a
temporary seizing in the middle; they are then placed fair by hand
round the rings, as you see in the Plate.

When one or two turns of rattling-stuff is taken round all parts, and
a heaver put through it, it is hove well round, which stretches all
parts snug round the ring. After it is all hove on neatly, put on the
seizings, four in number. (_See Plate._)

=72.=--A JACOB’S LADDER.

These ladders are used in many different parts of a ship of war; they
are used for stern ladders, rigging ladders, and on the swinging
booms in harbor, &c. There are several different ways of making them;
some are made salvagee fashion, and covered; others are made of
four-stranded rope, and have the rounds put through between the strands
of the rope. But the most general way of making these ladders, is to
take some small rope, (about two-inch stuff,) and make two straps the
length you intend to make the ladder, and splice them together with a
short-long-splice. The straps being made, get them on a stretch both
together, and see if they bear an equal strain; if not, shorten one
strap, so as to make both alike. Take a piece of chalk and mark off
where you intend the rounds to go, about fifteen inches apart.

The _rounds_ are pieces of round wood, about two inches in diameter,
of the length required, with a score on each end, for the rope to lay
in. Put the rounds in between both parts of the rope, exactly at the
chalk mark; having got them all placed, commence and seize them in, by
putting on a snug seizing of marline on each side of the round; you may
parcel, leather, or serve in the nips, just as may be preferred.

=73.=--CAN HOOKS

Are broad flat iron hooks, in the eyes of which thimbles are inserted.
What is termed a pair of can hooks, is a piece of rope four or five
feet long, or long enough to span a cask from chime to chime. When
fitted, one of these hooks are spliced into the end of this rope; it is
then got on a stretch, wormed, parceled and served, and a thimble is
sometimes seized in the bight, to hook on to, when lifting a cask.

_Note._--Some are fitted with chain, with a large iron ring in the
middle.

=74.=--HOGSHEAD SLINGS

Are pieces of rope about five fathoms long, and from five to six inches
in circumference, with a large thimble spliced in one end, and the
other end well whipped. They are used to sling large casks, being more
secure than can hooks. They are put on in this manner:--pass the bight
over one end of the cask, reeve the end through the thimble, and haul
it well taut; then take the end round the other end of the cask, and
take two half-hitches round the standing part, and it is done. (_See
Plate._)

=75.=--BARREL SLINGS

Are generally made of three inch rope, and of sufficient length to go
round the barrel. They are similar to a long strap, spliced together
with a short splice; it is passed round the barrel and one bight rove
through the other.

They are sometimes made long enough to sling two or three barrels at a
time.

=76.=--A SINGLE WHIP.

A single whip is the smallest and most simple purchase in use. It is
made by reeving a rope through a single block, as you see in the Plate.

=77.=--A GUN-TACKLE PURCHASE

Is made by reeving a rope through a single block, then through another
single block, and make the end fast to the one it was first rove
through, or splice it into the bottom of the block for neatness. (_See
Plate._)

=78.=--A LUFF-TACKLE PURCHASE

Consists of a double and single block; the rope is rove through one
of the sheave holes of the double block, then through the single one,
through the double one again, and the end made fast to the single
block, with a becket bend, to a becket in the bottom of the block.
(_See Plate._)

=79.=--A TOP BURTON

Is rove in the same manner as a luff-tackle purchase; the only
difference is, that the upper block of the burton is a fiddle block,
while that of the luff is a double one. (_See Plate._)

=80.=--WHIP AND RUNNER.

If a rope is rove through a single block, it is called a whip, as
before mentioned; and if the fall of this whip be spliced round the
block of another whip, it becomes whip on whip, or whip and runner.
(_See Plate._)

=81.=--A RUNNER AND TACKLE

Is the same purchase as a luff-tackle applied to a runner. A runner is
a large rope rove through a single block, with a hook spliced in one
end. (_See Plate._)

=82.=--A TWO-FOLD PURCHASE

Consists of two double blocks; the fall is first rove through one
sheave of the upper block, then through one of the lower ones; through
the upper one again, then through the lower one, and make the end fast
to the upper block.

=83.=--A THREE-FOLD PURCHASE.

A three-fold purchase is rove in this way, the blocks having one more
sheave, only that you commence to reeve the fall in the middle sheave
first,--instead of one of the side ones, which brings a cross in
the fall. The reason of its being rove in this manner, is, that the
heaviest strain comes first on the fall part, and if it was rove in the
side sheave, it would have a tendency to _cant the block in the strap_,
split the shell of the block, and cut the fall; but when it is in the
middle sheave it draws all down square alike.

=84.=--NAMES OF ROPES.

The different kinds of ropes are designated as follows:--

Hawser-laid and cable-laid rope is all the same; it is composed of
nine strands, each strand having an equal number of yarns. These nine
strands are laid into three, by twisting three small ones into one
large one; then the three large ones are laid up, or twisted together
left-handed, which makes the nine strands; this is a hawser-laid, or
cabled, rope.

A common or plain rope is composed of three strands, of an equal number
of yarns twisted together.

Shroud-laid rope is made in the same manner, only that it consists of
four strands instead of three, and a small strand which runs through
the middle, termed the heart of the rope. When plain-laid rope is laid
up left-handed, it is called _back-laid rope_. There is also four
stranded hawser-laid rope, which is used for stays, &c., &c.

[Illustration: A Ship Ready for Launching.]

PART II.

=85.=--LAUNCHING A SHIP.

After the carpenters have completed the hull of the vessel, the
necessary preparations for launching are commenced as follows:--

Get an anchor on each bow; get the cables on board and bend them to
the anchors; range and bitt the cables; bend the buoy ropes, and see
everything clear for letting go the anchors.

It will then be necessary to get four stout hawsers on the spar deck,
two on each side; bend one to the other, and have them coiled down
clear for running. This being done, pass the ends of two hawsers
out forward, through the warping chocks on each bow; pass the ends
aft, one on each side, and make them fast to some secure place, on
their respective sides of the launching slip, as clear of the ways
as possible. Stop the bights of the hawsers with a single rope-yarn
up along the ship’s sides, so as not to interfere with the ways, or
interrupt the progress of the carpenters while knocking away the shores
previous to launching.

Have men stationed to attend to veering the hawsers and cables when the
ship is off the ways, and also to letting go the anchors, if necessary.
Have a few buckets of water ready to throw on the bitts, to prevent any
danger that might occur from fire while veering the hawsers and cables.

The ways being well greased, and the necessary preparations for
launching completed, all the blocks and wedges by which the ship was
formerly supported, are driven out from under her keel, until the whole
weight gradually subsides upon the sliding ways, or cradle; a few
shores, or stanchions, remain, by which she is retained on the stocks
until the period for launching arrives, which is generally at high
water; they are then cut away, and all obstructions removed, with the
exception of the _dogshore_ (a representation of which is given in the
Plate). The word is given “to _launch_”--the dogshore is then knocked
away, which causes her to advance down the inclined plane into the
water.

If the ship should _hang_ after the dogshore is removed, it will be
necessary to apply screws under the fore-foot, which will cause her to
move immediately along the ways. The ways generally extend a sufficient
depth under the surface of the water to float the vessel when she
arrives at the extreme ends.

When the ship is off the stocks “veer away roundly,” and do not attempt
to check her until she begins to _deaden her way_, then check her
“handsomely” with the hawsers so as not to part them; if, however, they
should part, let go an anchor immediately; if that should not bring her
up, let go the other anchor, and veer gradually on both _cables_ until
she is brought up.

_Note._--When a ship is to be launched it is always customary to
hoist the ensign, jack, and pennant; the jack forward, ensign aft,
and the pennant amidships. Flagstaffs are erected for that purpose
previous to launching, as represented in the Plate, where you see a
ship of war ready to be launched from the stocks.

=86.=--CUTTING OUT STANDING RIGGING.

_Lower Rigging._--Measure the distance from the larboard side of the
mast-head to the foremost dead-eye in the starboard channels, which
distance set off on the floor of the rigging loft and stick in a
marlinespike at each extremity. The shroud stuff being stretched,
stop one end to one of the marlinespikes; take the bight round the
other and back again: this is the first pair of shrouds; pass it round
again, _outside at each end_, for the second pair, and continue in
this manner until one gang of rigging is completed. Mark the length of
the eyes straight across at the _opposite end_, to the one stopped to
the marlinespike; cut at the latter in an angular direction (so that
the after-legs will be a little longer than the forward ones), and
the inside pair will be the first pair of shrouds. Hitch a piece of
spun-yarn round each shroud, in the centre of the eye, making knots
on it according to the number of the shroud, commencing the inside
pair with one knot. The mark for the length of the eye gives the place
for the eye-seizing; the round of the rope giving their place on the
mast-head. (_Old fashion._)

The proportion for the eye is the round of the mast-head above the
bolsters; I have also seen the breadth of the seizing added (some allow
five squares of the mast-head, which is the best rule), supposing it
would lay fairer on the side of the bolsters than too close to the
mast-head. This precaution is hardly necessary, as the rigging will
stretch sufficiently in pulling up to bring the seizing down, no matter
how much it may have been stretched before being warped round for
cutting.

[Illustration: Sketch of a draft for cutting rigging.]

Rigging cut on the above old plan, causes great waste in squaring off
the ends, after fitting the eyes, previous to turning-in the dead-eyes.
I would therefore recommend (if not in a great hurry) a more economical
plan. Get the shroud-warp on a stretch, or rather one end of it, long
enough for one pair of shrouds; mark off the distance for the required
service, and when completed--being wormed, parceled, and served, while
on a taut stretch--measure the length with a tape-line, from _draft_
of first pair of shrouds, No. 1 starboard; when measured and chalked
the required length, “come up the stretch,” and cut at the chalk-mark;
middle the shroud at the centre of the service, and lay it on the loft
floor. Continue fitting, and cutting, in this way until you get the
number of shrouds required for the gang, allowing each pair of shrouds
to lap over the diameter of the rope at the eye, as they are laid on
the loft floor; alternately making due allowance at the ends, before
cutting, for the carry aft, or the jump of a port, if required. (_See
Plate._)

_Note._--In measuring the length of the shrouds, some prefer the
distance from the opposite side of the mast-head to the partners,
added to half the breadth of the deck, from the mast to the side.

In parceling, begin at each end where the service is to leave off,
and parcel upwards to the middle of the eye, where commence serving
downwards on each leg. The eye seizings are round ones, and when put
on, the whole eye is neatly covered with parceling. A half-sister
block is sometimes put between the two forward shrouds, for the lower
boom topping lift to lead through.

=87.=--TOPMAST AND TOP-GALLANT RIGGING

Is cut in the same manner. In fitting the topmast rigging, always
seize-in a sister-block between the two forward shrouds, for the
topsail lift and reef tackles. The swifters are generally served the
whole length.

The eyes of the top-gallant rigging are made to fit exactly around the
cylinder; if there is an odd topmast, or top-gallant shroud, on each
side, they are either fitted with a horse-shoe eye, or go together with
a cut splice.

=88.=--BREAST AND STANDING BACKSTAYS.

These may be cut by the same rule; the eyes of the breast backstays are
fitted in different ways. They are sometimes spanned together, making
a square, the size of the mast-head; sometimes they have an eye like
the shrouds, made to fit close; and others have a small eye seized in
the bight, and lashed round the mast-head. The eyes of the standing
backstays are fitted like those of the shrouds.

=89.=--CAT HARPEN LEGS, AND FUTTOCK SHROUDS.

Take one-third the breadth of the top, and lay of that distance from
the eye-seizing, down upon the shrouds, each side; draw a line across
which will represent the cat harpens, and measured on the scale, will
give their length; splice in eyes at each end; worm, parcel, serve, and
leather them. The distance from the extremity of the top and this line
upon the shroud, will give the length of the futtock shrouds, which
must have a hook and thimble in their upper ends, and a thimble in
their lower ends.

=90.=--FORE-AND-AFT STAYS.

Measure from the after parts of the mast-head to where the stays set
up, and to this distance add the length of the mast-head, for collars.

Collars for stays are the length of their respective mast-heads. The
mousings are raised once-and-a-half the size of the stays, and at a
distance equal to twice the length of the mast-head from the mousing.
A Flemish eye is worked on the end, and the stay rove through it; or
they may be fitted with lashing eyes, in which case each leg is the
length of the mast-head; the service is continued the length of the
eye below the mousing, the collars leathered, and the hearts turned
in with the lay of the rope. Stays are wormed, parcelled, served, and
leathered in the wake of all nipps, such as the bees, bullock-blocks,
and sheave-holes.

=91.=--CUTTING LOWER MAST HEAD-PENDANTS.

The forward pair should be twice the length of the mast-head--the after
pair twice-and-a-half; thimbles are spliced in the ends, and they are
wormed or spanned together, so as to form a span to fit the mast-head.

=92.=--BOBSTAYS.

The bobstays are cut twice the length from the collars, on the
bowsprit, to their respective holes on the cutwater. They are wormed,
parceled, and served the whole length, and leathered in the nipp, after
which they are rove through the holes, spliced together, and the dead
eyes turned in, in the wake of a splice.

=93.=--BOWSPRIT SHROUDS.

The length from the bowsprit to the eye-bolts in the bows; a dead-eye
or heart is spliced into one end, and a hook and thimble in the other.

=94.=--JIB AND FLYING JIB GUYS.

Take the distance from the boom-end to the bows, making a small
allowance for reeving through the straps on the spritsail yard. They
are generally fitted with a cuckold’s neck over the boom end, and set
up with dead-eyes to the bows. The cuckold’s neck is served or covered
with canvass. The guys in the wake of the spritsail yard are leathered.
The martingales must be cut, and fitted to the manner in which they are
rove.

=95.=--CUTTING RUNNING RIGGING.

The greater part of the running rigging may be cut as it is rove,
making due allowance for the hands to clap on. The length and size may
also be got from the rigging table for all classes in the navy (see
rigging tables). The most proper way to ascertain the length of a rope
is from the _draft_, or rigging plan of the vessel you are employed
upon, making the proper allowance for leading out, &c., &c.

=96.=--RIGGING SHEERS, AND TAKING IN MASTS AND BOWSPRIT.

In cases where there is neither sheers nor wharf to have recourse to,
in order to get the lower masts on board, it becomes necessary to get
such spars as can be procured, and erect a pair of sheers on board for
that purpose.

In doing this proceed as follows:--Take in a sufficiency of ballast to
steady the ship, and shore the decks from the skin up, particularly
abreast of the partners. Sling skids up and down the sides; reeve the
parbuckles, and bring the sheer legs alongside, with their small ends
aft; parbuckle them on board, raise one leg over the capstan, and their
heads or after ends resting either on the taffrail, the break of the
poop, or a spar placed in the most convenient spot, the more elevated
the better. Square the heels exactly one with the other, so that when
they come to be raised the legs may be found of equal height.

As near the after ends of the spars as may be considered necessary,
when crossed, put on the head-lashing of new, well-stretched rope
(_figure-of-8 fashion_), similar to a racking seizing, and cross with
the ends. Open out the heels, carrying one over to each gangway, and
placing it on a solid piece of oak or shoe, previously prepared for
the purpose. Clap stout tackles on the heels, two on each, one leading
forward, the other aft; set taut the after ones, and belay them. Lash
a three or four-fold block, as the upper one of the main purchase,
over the main lashing (so that it will hang plumb under the cross),
with canvass underneath to prevent chafing; and in such a manner that
one-half the turns of the lashing may go over each horn of the sheers,
and divide the strain equally; also sufficiently long to secure the
free action of the block. Lash the small purchase block on the after
horn of the sheers, sufficiently high for the falls to play clear of
each other, and a girtline block above all.

Middle a couple of hawsers, and clove-hitch them over the sheer
heads--having two ends leading forward, and two abaft, led through viol
blocks, and stout luffs clapped on them. These should be sufficiently
strong to secure the sheers while lifting the masts.

The lower purchase block is lashed forward (perhaps round the
cut-water), and the fall being rove, the sheers are raised by heaving
upon it, and preventing the heels from slipping forward, by means of
the heel tackles previously mentioned.

Sometimes a small pair of sheers are erected for the purpose of raising
the heads of the large ones; in which case care must be taken to place
them so as to allow the heads or horns of the other pair to pass
through.

When the sheers are up, or nearly perpendicular, _cleat the shoes_, so
as to confine the heels to their places upon them. They can then be
transported along the deck by means of the heel-tackles and guys to the
situation required, taking care to make them rest upon a beam, and to
have the deck properly shored up below.

Finally, give the sheers the necessary rake by means of the guys, and
set taut all the guys and heel-tackles. Also, five or six feet above
the deck, on each leg, put two cleats, for the purpose of applying two
stout lashings from _them above_, to the dead-eyes in the channels
_below_, in order to give greater security; this being done, the sheers
may be considered ready. (_See Plate_).

[Illustration: Masting and Dismasting.

FIG. 1.

FIG. 2.

FIG. 3.

Method of forming Sheers, and removing a Mainmast, by means of 2
Topm’st]

_Note._--The skids which are slung up and down the sides, are for
the purpose of keeping the sheer-legs clear of the channels, and
from thence to the plank shear. Mats should also be placed over the
quarter galleys to prevent injury.

_Parbuckles_ are hawsers which are middled; the ends of which are
taken through two ports which are about five or six ports apart, from
outside, in; down over the rail, under the sheer legs; up again through
snatch blocks, in the opposite water-ways, and luffs clapped on them.
The counter parbuckles are used to ease the sheer legs down on deck,
and are rove through the gun-deck ports. Mats should be placed in the
wake of the chafe, where the parbuckle leads over the rail, or up
through the gun-deck ports.

The parbuckling on board of heavy spars for sheers may be much
facilitated at times, and injury to the ship avoided, by attending to
circumstances, and getting them in at slack water, or over the bows or
stern.

When a ship is confined to her own resources, the lower yards are the
best spars for sheers; the heels (or yard-arms resting on the deck)
being strengthened where they taper by a temporary fish, _woolded on_,
and the woolding set up by wedges.

In a brig, the main yard and main boom are the best spars for sheers
(if other spars are not available).

The shoes are made of either stout oak plank or beam timbers of pine,
and long enough to extend over at least three beams, with a saucer in
them for the heels to rest in; likewise, mortices or bolts in each end
for lashing. The spare caps will be found very handy for placing the
heels of the spars in, and the eye-bolts in them convenient for hooking
the heel-tackles, and transporting along the decks.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

=97.=--TO TAKE IN THE MIZEN-MAST.

Tow the mizen-mast alongside, with the head aft, and the garland[1]
lashed on to the forward part of the mast, at the distance from the
tennon to just above the spar deck partners; lash a pair of girtline
blocks on the mast-head, and reeve the girtlines; bend the sheer-head
girtline to the mast below the bibbs to _cant_ it. Overhaul the main
purchase down abaft, thrust the strap through the eyes of the garland,
toggle it, and secure the toggle by a back-lashing. Take the fall to
the capstan and “heave round;” when the heel rises near the rail, hook
on a heel-tackle to ease it inboard. Get the mast fair for lowering
by means of the girtlines, have carpenters attending below, wipe the
tennon dry, and white lead both it and the step, “lower away,” and step
the mast.

Pass a couple of straps around the mast; to each of these hook the
double blocks of the pendant tackles--the single ones to the sides,
and hauled taut; wedge the mast temporarily, “come up” the purchases,
man the guy and heel tackles, wet the decks, and transport the sheers
forward for taking in the main-mast.

The object of taking in the mizen-mast first is, because the breadth of
beam is less aft than forward; and the heels of the sheers being spread
more as they go forward, the head lashing consequently becomes tauter;
moreover, if the mizen-mast was taken in _last_, the bowsprit must be
got in _first_, and thus the _advantage_ of securing the sheers to the
foremast-head, when getting in the bowsprit, would be lost.

[1] Garlands are made of new rope, well stretched (salvagee fashion),
marled together and parceled. They are laid on the forward part of
the mast, a stout lashing put on over all, and crossed between the
garland and the mast;--a good dogging also, if necessary, passed
downward.

=98.=--TO TAKE IN THE MAIN AND FOREMAST.

Proceed in the same manner as in getting in the mizen mast. The garland
for the small purchase should be lashed about the diameter of the mast,
_above_ the main purchase.

In taking in either of the masts, if the sheers should be found to
be a few inches short, the difficulty may be remedied by manning the
forward guy-falls, and bringing the sheers perpendicular to the deck.
Some distance may also be saved by using no garlands and having the
purchase blocks lashed to the mast. If in lowering there should still
be a difficulty, chocks might be placed on the kelson until the tennon
rested on them; then steady the mast by means of the small purchase and
sheer-head girtlines, while the main purchase is unlashed, and lashed
again on the mast sufficiently high to step it.

If the ship has a top-gallant forecastle, it would be well to step the
mast forward of the sheer legs, for the brake of the forecastle comes
abreast of the partners; and, in a case of this kind, it would be well
to take in the foremast first.

=99.=--TO TAKE IN THE BOWSPRIT.

Transport the sheers as far forward as possible, or as the bows will
permit; send a hand to the sheer-head, bend on the girtlines to the
small purchase block to light it up, unlash it, and lash it again
to the forward fork or horns of the sheers, pass a strap round the
foremast-head, to which hook a large tackle, carry it well aft, and
haul it taut, for the purpose of staying the mast. Lash a couple
of large single blocks to the foremast-head, middle a hawser, and
clove-hitch it over the sheer-head; reeve the ends through the blocks
at the mast-head, down on deck, carry them well aft, and take a turn.
Hook the after heel-tackles forward, and take the after-guys aft;
pass a bulwark lashing round each heel, rake the sheers over the bows
sufficiently for the main purchase to hang directly over the gammoning
scuttle, and make all fast.

The bowsprit being brought under the bows, with the head forward, and
the garlands lashed on, the main one a little more than one-third from
the heel, the smaller one between the cap and bees, having guys leading
from the bowsprit to the cat-heads, and a couple of straps round the
heel for hooking the bedding tackles. Overhaul down the purchases
and toggle them; “sway away,” attending it by the guys, until nearly
perpendicular; hook on the bedding tackles, which are taken from the
bitts on the main deck, and led up through the partners; wipe the
tennon dry, and white-lead both it and the mortice; “lower away,”
bouse upon the bedding tackles, and bring it into its place; come up
purchases, guys, unlash garlands, and proceed to dismantle the sheers.

If the ship has a topgallant forecastle, you will be unable to take in
the bowsprit with the sheers without the assistance of a _derrick_[2]
on account of the brake of the forecastle, it not being prudent to step
sheers on the top of it.

When the ship is masted, and alongside the yard, commence getting
on board and stowing ballast and tanks; fit the rudder, gammon the
bowsprit, fit and set up the bobstays and bowsprit shrouds; fit fore
stay collars; get on board tops, caps, cross-trees, topmasts and
topgallant masts, placing lower yards athwart ships, topsail and
topgallant yards amidships; also, have ready tackles and luffs for
setting up the rigging and staying the masts, top-blocks with lashings
for top-ropes, and all the rigging at hand and in order.

[2] See Derrick, in Miscellaneous Articles.

=100.=--GAMMONING THE BOWSPRIT.

In rigging a stage under the bowsprit for this purpose, make use of two
small spars, such as topgallant studding-sail booms, with their heels
lashed to the head-rail, their heads frapped together, and slung from
the bowsprit end, and boards laid across from one to the other.

The gammoning is of new, well-stretched rope, generally water-laid.
One end of the gammoning being whipt, is passed through the hole in
the cutwater, and over the bowsprit with a round turn, then clenched
round the bowsprit close against the stop or cleats; the other end
passes through the forepart of the hole in the cutwater, again round
the bowsprit (but before the clinch), and again through the hole in the
cutwater, abaft the first turn. All the succeeding turns go in the same
way, laying forward on the bowsprit and aft in the cutwater, and all
are passed inside of the first turns; by which means the outer turns on
the bowsprit which bear the most strain are more preserved from chafing
than the inner ones.

[Illustration: A Representation of the Masting Shears in the New-York
Navy Yard, for the Masting and Dismasting of large ships.]

The turns are then hove taut as follows:--A leading block is made
fast to the holes for the bobstays by a strap long enough to admit of
the pendant, which is then rove through it, leading straight through
the hawse-hole to the capstan. In one end of this pendant an eye is
spliced, through which a bight of the gammoning is passed, and retained
by means of a toggle, while to the other end is hooked a long tackle,
and the fall led to the capstan. As each turn is hove taut, it is, by
some, nailed to the bowsprit, and by others, racked in several places,
which is preferable to nailing.[3]

When all the turns are passed and hove taut, they are frapped together
by as many crossturns as are passed on the bowsprit. The end is then
whipped and seized to one of the turns.

In ships with two gammonings, the outer one is hove taut first, as it
would otherwise slack the inner one.

_Note._--Iron gammoning is now allowed for vessels of all classes in
the service. (_See Rigging Table._)

[3] See Gammoning the Bowsprit, in Miscellaneous Articles.

=101.=--FITTING RIGGING.

The shroud is hove well taut, with a tackle clapped on one end, and the
other secured to a sampson post. It is wormed, parceled, and served a
third down from the seizing; the swifter or foremost shroud all the
way, except where the dead-eye is turned in. A sword mat is sometimes
laced on the foremost shroud, which, I think, answers much better, as
it can be taken off and the rope dried; and, from the different ropes
I have seen rotted under the service, I feel convinced, the less on
rigging, unless where absolutely necessary, the better.

In parceling the eyes, commence from each end of the service and finish
in the centre, and pass several riding parts, as in breaking the shroud
to form the eye, the service gets opened, which allows the wet to get
in; and if the service is begun in the centre, doubled, and then passed
toward each end, it will prevent the wet getting to the rope.

In forming the eye, take a good strand, knot both ends together, and
lay it across both parts of the shroud; having brought them as close
together as possible, pass both bights of the strand under the shroud
clear of each other; then place a long bolt across, close to the strand
on the upper side; take a round turn round the bolt with each bight of
the strand on each side of the shroud, put a smaller bolt through each
eye in the strand, and _heave it round_ the long bolt, and as the turns
accumulate on the bolt, both parts of the shroud come together; when
quite close pass the eye seizing, the shroud being previously parceled
in the way of it.

When there is an odd on each side, it is fitted horse-shoe fashion to
fit the mast-head; parceled, and served over a third down the same as
the other shrouds. I have seen the odd shroud put on the mast-head
first (after the pendants), instead of last; and then the others put on
in rotation: No. 1 starboard, No. 2 larboard, No. 3 starboard, &c., &c.

=102.=--FITTING MAST-HEAD PENDANTS.

The long leg, when two, should be a third of the shroud. The eye is
formed the same as the shroud: wormed, parceled, &c. A thimble is
spliced in each end, the ends put in once and a-half, marled down, and
served over. The foremost leg is once and a-half the round of the rope
shorter than the after one. The thimbles are well parceled before being
spliced in.

Small ships have only one pendant on each side; when this is the case,
the rope is cut to the proper length, the starboard pendant is spliced
into the larboard, and the larboard into the starboard, with a cut
splice forming an eye, or span, to fit the square of the mast-head; a
thimble is spliced into each end, and they are wormed, parceled and
served;--they are the same length as a long leg, when a pair on each
side.

=103.=--LOWER AND TOPMAST STAYS.

Stays are four stranded, and are now both the same size, and lashed
abaft the mast-heads. The legs are made for the collar in laying up.
When sufficient length is laid up for the stay, from whence the collar
commences to the end for setting up, two strands, one for each, are
left sufficiently long to double back, and are then laid up as four
strands, forming the lashing eyes and legs. The ends of the strands
are then unlaid, the inside ones wormed into the lay of the rope; the
other strands are divided, laid up, and worked in alongside the first
strands; then some more yarns are twisted smaller and used as backing;
some inside yarns from each strand should be wormed into the stay their
whole length, below the crotch; the legs are then wormed, so as to
completely fill the rope, commencing from the centre of the eyes for
lashing, which should be well opened with a large setting fid, and
worming carried into the stay as far down as the worming of the legs.
The outside yarns of the legs are then marled down, over all, round the
stay, tapering the ends. The legs are well parceled and served, and
likewise the stay, sufficiently far down to take the lower yards, and
covered with tanned hide.

The stays should be hove well out with purchases, and allowed to hang,
pulling up occasionally. I have known a line-of-battle ship’s stays
(cable laid rope) to stretch out twelve feet, and after a two month’s
cruise were long enough to allow nearly two feet to be taken off the
fore-stays.

Stays fitted with lashing eyes are decidedly preferable, as they are
easier shifted; the collars not being so long the yards can be slung
higher up, and consequently braced further forward.

In the merchant service the stays are also fitted on the bight, or two
in one, as follows: the bight is put over the mast-head and both ends
taken forward and set up in their respective places. Others again put
the bight under the bowsprit and set them up abaft the mast head, with
lashing eyes, putting on a seizing at the proper place to form the
collar. This last plan would not answer for a ship of war.

=104.=--TO RIG THE FOREMAST.

White-lead the mast-head in the wake of the trestle-trees, over haul
down the girtlines, bend on the trestle-trees and sway them on board;
take out the after chock, wipe them dry, bend the girtlines to the
forward part and stop the girtlines to the after part; bend the main
girtline to the after part also; “sway away,” having a steadying-line
forward to keep the trestle-trees from catching under the bibbs, for if
they should be heavy, one man aloft will not be able to bear them off;
when above the bibbs, send a hand aloft to slip the stops, one at a
time, so as to let them come down gradually. “Lower away,” bouse on the
after girtlines, and get the trestle-trees in their places; send aloft
the after chock, ship and bolt it. Tar the mast-head in the way of the
rigging; overhaul down the girtlines for the bolsters, which are tarred
and parceled; sway them aloft and stop them; lash the girtline blocks
to the after part of trestle-trees.

The rigging is then sent up by the girtlines in the following manner:--

_Mast head pendants._--Foremost pair of shrouds, starboard side;
foremost pair of shrouds, larboard side; second pair of shrouds,
starboard side; second pair of shrouds, larboard side, and so on
until all the shrouds are over, after which send up the stay, and
last of all the preventer or spring-stay.

_Placing the rigging._--The girtlines being overhauled down send
aloft the lower pendants, which have got a long and short leg, fitted
together with a span, or square, the size of the mast-head; the long
leg is placed abaft, so that in case of the forestay being shot away,
the pendant tackles can be hooked in them without being in the way
of the fore-yard in bracing; while the leg being abaft, the mast
affords them good security. As soon as the mast-head pendants are
placed they ought to be lashed abaft, the tackles hooked, and the
mast stayed by them. Overhaul down the girtlines, bend the mast-head
one on the shroud, with a timber-hitch, or toggle, four or five feet
below the seizing, and stop it to the centre of the eye; take the
girtline from the after trestle-tree, and bend it half way down the
shroud; “sway away,” on the lower girtline, and lift the weight of
the shroud. When high enough, the stop in the eye is cut, and it will
fall over the mast-head; the men on the trestle-trees placing it fair
on the bolsters, beating it well down, with commanders, and observing
to have the eye-seizing come as near the centre of the mast-head as
possible. The larboard pair is got up in the same manner, and so on
until all are placed. Reeve the lanyards, if prepared with a knot on
the end; a double-wall and crowned is preferable, a mathew-walker
being liable to capsize; the lanyard should be rove through the hole
under the end of the shroud, because in setting it up, the strain
comes on the shroud first, and keeps the dead-eye in its place; if
put under the standing part, the strain coming on the end first, the
dead-eye would _slue round_.

_Setting up the lower rigging._--The rigging is often placed and then
set up, but I would prefer (if time would permit) having it pulled up
as placed. When the first pair on each side are over and placed, and
the lanyards rove through both dead-eyes, clap a selvagee strap on
each shroud well up; to this hook the single block of a luff tackle;
the double, to a blackwall hitch in the lanyard; then take the lower
blocks of the pendant tackles and hook them to both the falls of
the luffs on each side; reeve the tackle falls through the leading
blocks, and pull up, setting up both pair of shrouds at the same
time, the men on the trestle-trees beating the shroud down as pulled
up; when well up, place two pair more, and proceed in this manner
until the mast is rigged.[4]

The advantage of pulling up a pair at each side, instead of singly,
is evident from the fact that pulling up singly injures the seizing;
as it is first dragged _forward_ and then _aft_ by the after leg, it
is liable to slack the seizing, and perhaps snap the inside turns.

In rigging the lower masts, I have seen the after swifter go over
first; a plan that is now adopted in small vessels. In staying the
mast these swifters should be set taut, the mast being previously
wedged, and the stays set steadily up. I have heard some old sailors
dispute this plan, it being new, but for my own part I think well of
it.

_Note._--The trestle-trees might be got over without knocking out the
after-chocks, by running up a derrick abaft the mast, well lashed
abaft below the bibbs, having chocks placed between it and the mast,
sufficient to admit of the free passage of the after chock of the
trestle-trees. They are sometimes got on before getting in the mast,
but they then bring in an additional and unnecessary weight upon the
mast-head, and moreover, in lowering, catch over the shear-head.

N. B. The blocks for _topmast stays_ should be put on _after_ the
second pair of shrouds (on foremast).

[4] See note on lower rigging.

[Illustration]

=105.=--FUTTOCK SHROUDS

Are now fitted, and hooked to the futtock plates in the top, and set up
to an iron band round the mast. In small vessels these are iron, and
set up with turnbuckles, or screws. Cat-harpens are seldom used, being
considered unnecessary lumber aloft.

_Note._--The futtock shrouds are hooked to their respective plates,
_with the points of the hooks in_.

=106.=--TO RIG THE MAIN AND MIZEN-MAST.

Proceed in the same manner as directed for the foremast. The mainmast
of a frigate has one more pair of shrouds than the foremast, and the
mizen-mast three less. The mizen-mast has only one pendant on each
side, fitted with a cut-splice, and a thimble spliced in each end. The
rigging is placed the same as the fore or main; the mast is steadied
into its place with a couple of long burtons, one to each pendant, and
hooked to straps round the bitts, or to ring-bolts in the fore part of
the quarterdeck bulwarks. If the stays are not ready for going up, the
tackles can be hooked to a lashing round the mast, the pendants being
wanted to pull up the rigging (for placing); the rigging is the same as
the fore.

In setting up the main-stays, pass one _under_, the other _over_,
around the cross-piece in the four bitts, for the purpose; clap the
selvagee straps well up the stay, and two more near the ends; to these
hook two luffs; to the falls of the luffs hook the lower blocks of main
tackles; reeve their falls through leading blocks, in as direct a line
with the stay as possible, and grease the bitts in the way of the stay.

In placing the main stays, in the manner mentioned above, there is
sufficient space between the stays for a shot to pass through, which
often prevents their being both cut away at the same time.

When the rigging is to be set up for a full due, the stays in the way
of the bitts are well wormed, parceled, served, and covered with hide;
and the ends of the stays, and all the lower rigging whipped, and
covered with canvass caps (neatly fitted).

=107.=--TO RIG THE BOWSPRIT.

[Illustration]

_Bobstays._--The rope should be well stretched, wormed, parceled,
and served, and in the way of the cutwater covered with leather;
when none is to be had, pass two parts of parceling, the first
against, the second with the lay of the rope; and serve with good
stout spun-yarn, or four-yarn plait; then reeve them through the
cutwater, splice both ends together, put the strands in once each
way, marl down, and serve over. The hearts are then secured in their
place (keeping the splice on the upper side) with a round seizing,
with parceling under it. They are sometimes fitted to shackle to the
cutwater, with iron plates let in flush with the wood, a bolt going
through both plates, which is very snug and strong.

_Bowsprit Shrouds_ are single pieces of rope. When cut the required
length (a hook and thimble), the latter parceled, is spliced into one
end, put in once-and-a-half, marled down and served over; a heart is
spliced into the other. After being hooked to eye-bolts in the bows
for the purpose, they are set up to their collars on the bowsprit.

A celebrated master (now a commander) in the navy, and a first
rate seaman, never served the bowsprit rigging _all over_; it is,
certainly, in my opinion, better not to do so, as the water can never
lodge, which it may do, by getting in from broken service, which
cannot be repaired at sea. They are now fitted one-third chain, on
account of the chain cable chafing against them.

It is not unusual, in small vessels, to insert thimbles instead of
hearts in the bobstays, bowsprit shrouds, and collars; covering the
lanyards neatly afterwards, with canvass.

_Placing the rigging._--Tar well the bowsprit; then put on the first
forestay collar, first pair bowsprit shroud collars, first bobstay
collar; second bobstay collar; second pair of shroud collars;
spring-stay collar; and cap bobstay collar; then heave them close up,
pass and heave well _on_ with a rose-lashing.

The man-ropes are spliced, or hooked into bolts in the bowsprit cap,
and in the other end an eye is spliced; ends put in once-and-a-half,
and set up with a lanyard to an eye-bolt in knight-heads or
stanchions, for the purpose; splices served over, and leathered in
the nip.

The goblines[5] are either clove-hitched, or may be fitted with a
cuckold’s neck around the end of the dolphin-striker, and set up to
the bows, one on each side.

[5] Called back-ropes by some.

=108.=--GETTING THE TOPS OVER.

_Whole tops._--Overhaul the girtlines for the cross-trees, white-lead
the squares in the trestle-trees, and ship them. The girtlines being
on each side of the mast-head are then overhauled down for the tops;
one end is passed from underneath, and up through the hole for futtock
plate and hitched to the standing part; the girtline can be rove down
through one of the holes in the edge of lubber’s hole; the girtline
stopped to the foremost edge, to holes bored for the purpose. A
girtline is taken from the mizen-mast-head, and bent to the foremost
part of maintop; bend on a tripping line to the pigeon hole leading
from the foremast-head. Man the girtlines and “sway away;” when
sufficiently high to allow the foremost edge of lubber’s hole to clear
the mast-head, cut the stops and cant it over by the tripping line, and
the top will hang in the girtlines, when it can be lowered, placed, and
bolted.

I have seen girtlines bent from the foremost part of the fore-top to
the bowsprit end; and from foremast to the forward part of the maintop;
and from mainmast to foremost part of mizen-top, to assist in getting
the tops over; but if they are properly slung it is not necessary.

The dead-eyes for the topmast rigging can now be hauled up, and put
in their places in the top-rims: and also ship the top-rail, and
stanchions in their respective places.

=109.=--GETTING HALF-TOPS OVER.

Unlash the girtline blocks from each side of the mast-head, and lash
them on the foremost and after sides; send the end of the foremost
girtline down abaft all, the other between the cross-trees.

If the starboard half is to be got over, place it on the deck with
its upper side up, or on its edge with the upper side aft. Take the
foremost girtline, reeve it down through the foremost hole, by lubber’s
hole for the purpose, (or from aft forward, if on its edge,) take it
underneath the top, and if the hole for the futtock plate will take it,
reeve it up, (or from forward, aft, if on its edge,) and half-hitch it
to the mast-head, or standing part; then take the mast-head part under
the top, (if on its edge, to the foremost side,) and seize it well to
the foremost corner with a piece of small rope, through a hole bored
for the purpose. Take the after girtline, reeve it the same way through
the after hole bored for the purpose in the after part of lubber’s
hole; pass, and half-hitch it the same way as the fore one, and secure
it with a good seizing of small rope, through another hole bored in the
foremost corner. If the futtock holes will not take the girtlines, stop
them with spun-yarn. The top should be so balanced in the girtlines,
as to hang fair when the stops are cut. Reeve the other ends of the
girtlines through the leading blocks; man them, and sway up the top
with the after girtline; at the same time taking in the slack of the
fore one. Have men stationed at the trestle-trees to bear off, cut the
stops, and place. When the edge is clear of the cross-trees, cut the
after stop and sway on both girtlines; and when the foremost corner is
well up, cut the stops; the top will then hang in the girtlines, and
can be easily placed. Shift the girtlines for the larboard half, get
it up the same way, bolt and secure the top. Shift the girtlines on
each side of the mast head, as they were before. A girtline from the
mizenmast-head is sometimes bent to the foremost edge of the main-top,
to assist in bearing off; (it can be dispensed with;) a rope’s end bent
to the top and hauled well aft, will answer the same purpose. Half-tops
may be swayed up, before the cross trees are sent aloft, and hung to
the mast-head, one half on each side, swayed chock up; then send up the
cross-trees, and bolt them to the trestle-trees; lower the half tops
down on the cross-trees; place and secure them as before.

_Note._--In cold weather it would be best to get the tops over before
rigging the masts, in order to give the men a more secure place for
standing while placing the rigging; and in this case a derrick rigged
on the top would be the best way to get the rigging over in a heavy
ship. (If the topmast is pointed and swayed about six feet above the
lower mast-head, it will make a good derrick for getting the lower
rigging over.)

=110.=--GETTING UP TOP-BLOCKS, &c.

Top-blocks are large single blocks, having iron straps, which are
formed after being put round the block, into a large hook. Overhaul
down the girtlines through lubber’s hole; bend one part through the
sheave hole of the block, and stop it to the back part of the hook;
hoist it up, and lash it to the mast-head around the hook, with a
lashing long enough to allow the block to hang half-mast-head high.
Through this block reeve a hawser; send the foremost end down through
the square hole in the foremost part of the trestle-trees; the after
end through the lubber’s hole through a leading block on deck, and
round the capstan.

=111.=--GETTING UP THE TOPMAST.

Take two half-hitches through the fid-hole, with the foremost end of
the hawser, and stop the hawser well round the hounds of the topmast
with a good lashing. Man the capstan, and heave the mast up and down.
Unbend the hawser, reeve it through the sheave-hole in the topmast;
send a hauling line down through the trestle-trees for the end of the
hawser, which haul up and clinch round the lower mast-head over the
block. Overhaul the girtlines down before all, and get the cap into the
top.

_Note._--Pendant tackles may be used to a greater advantage than a
hawser in pointing a topmast, when light handed.

=112.=--GETTING THE CAP INTO THE TOP.

Bend the foremost end of the girtlines, which were sent down before
all, through the round hole in the cap, and stop them along to the
after part of the square hole, keeping the bolts in the cap _up_.[6]
Man the girtlines and “sway away,” bearing well off the fore part of
the top. When high enough, lower, and place the round hole over the
square hole in the trestle-trees. Sway the topmast well through and
lash it securely to the cap; put a capstan bar in the fid-hole with
a hauling line on the end, and heave the topmast up; when the cap is
clear of the lower mast-head, haul on the line from the bar in the heel
of the topmast, and it will slue the mast and bring the square hole
of the cap over the lower masthead; ship the cap-shore, then lower
the hawser, or tackle, and place the cap, beating it into its place.
Land the mast, unreeve the hawser, unlash the top blocks, and hook
them to their proper bolts on each side of the cap; reeve the hawser
through one block, through the trestle-trees, through the sheave in the
top-mast, up through trestle-trees again, and reeve the end through
the foremost bolt in the cap on the opposite side of the block; before
reeving it through, parcel it well; take two half-hitches on its own,
or standing part, and secure the end with a round seizing of spun-yarn.
Bring the hawser to the capstan, heave the topmast up and try the fit;
(then lower away, get the topmast on deck, and try the other set);
and then lower the mast for rigging. Secure the girtline blocks to
eye-bolts in the cap, or to the topmast cross-trees.

_Note._--The stop should be taken off the hounds of the topmast,
directly it is pointed through the trestle-trees; and when getting on
deck, after it is landed, single the hawser the same as when getting
up and down, and stop it to the hounds; then have slip ropes on the
heel to haul it forward or aft, whether fore or main, and place it
on the chocks, for stowing on the booms. A fore-topmast is generally
stowed with the head forward; a main with the head aft; both heads
are sometimes stowed forward, a practice that is frequently adopted
at the present day.

[6] The object of _keeping the bolts up_ in getting the cap into the
top, is, that they may not catch on the top rim and cause delay, and
perhaps injury. (_It is not intended to be shipped so._)

=113.=--TURNING IN DEAD-EYES.

If in the loft, get the length from the mast-head to the deck, from
the draft, if the masts are not stepped, and place the dead-eye to
that length, making due allowance for stretching in setting up. Turn
the dead-eye in as near the end as possible, so that all parts of the
shroud may be equally stretched, which will prevent its having _a gouty
end_.

The principal caution is to keep the lay in the rope, as it prevents
the wet getting in. If the shroud is to be wormed, and served in the
wake of the dead-eye, the worming should not be hove in too taut, as
breaking the shroud round the dead-eye would probably snap it.

The score being well tarred, the end of the shroud is taken underneath,
round the dead-eye, inside standing, or mast-head part; a bolt is put
in a hole of the dead-eye. Take a good strand, knot both ends together;
it is then middled and crossed round the end of the shroud; both bights
are taken round the bolt, one on each side of the dead-eye, and a
smaller bolt put in each bight, which are hove round the large bolt in
the dead-eye. As the turns accumulate, it heaves the shroud taut round.
The dead-eye should be secured through one of the holes with spun yarn
to the shroud before heaving, where the shroud is marked, for the lower
part. When the dead-eye is turned in, in a loft, the shroud is hove in
with a jigger, (or dead-eye machine).

When the shroud is hove well round, pass a good throat-seizing. When
secured, take out the bolts, get a small jigger, hook one end to a
strap round the end of the shroud, and the other to the mast-head part;
take a good strand, knot both ends together, take it round the end and
standing or masthead part; put a bolt in both bights, and heave it
round, pulling up the jigger at the same time; this will bring the end
taut up, as heaving on the strap brings both parts close together; then
pass a round, or quarter seizing, and a smaller one on the end.

If the rigging is turned in on shore, keep the lay in the rope, and
when sent out of the loft, to be placed on the mast-head, keep the ends
inside, the shrouds being marked with a knot or a piece of spun-yarn,
according to the number. The ends will lay aft on one side, and forward
on the other; this is of importance and should be remembered.

_Turning in dead-eyes_, termed _Cutter stay-fashion_.--The dead-eye
being placed to the mark, the end is passed round it as before, but
instead of being secured with a throat-seizing, the end is passed
round the standing-part and seized to the part round the dead-eye
with a round-seizing, and another on the end further round the
dead-eye. The same precaution as in the other way, keep the lay in
the rope and _end_ inside.

_Note._--Worming and serving _shrouds_ in the wake of the dead-eyes
is not a common practice in all ships, but I would recommend it as
a great preservative to the shrouds, if they were served at least
six feet above the dead-eyes. I have known of many gangs of rigging
condemned on account of the shrouds being _magged_ and _chafed_ in
the wake of the dead-eyes and throat-seizing, for want of service,
when all other parts of the shrouds were found to be good.

=114.=--GETTING TOPMAST CROSSTREES OVER.

Overhaul a girtline through the round hole in the cap; and if they
are to go up from the starboard side, overhaul and send it down, and
the after girtline outside the top; hitch that through the round hole
in the cap, well out on the starboard foremost horns underneath, and
secure the end with a good seizing of spun-yarn; the after one bend on
in the same way, to the after starboard horn; then stop both girtlines
well with spun-yarn, close to the trestle-trees, and also with two
stops, on the larboard horns; “sway away;” having a guy from the deck
to clear it of the top, as it goes aloft. When the upper, or larboard
horns are well clear of the cap, take two rope’s ends from the larboard
side of the top, and bend them to the larboard horns, and man them in
the top--these are called “steadying lines,” and are used to prevent
the crosstrees _falling back_, if a stop is cut too soon, and to assist
in getting the crosstrees on the cap, and over the mast-head. “Sway
higher,” cutting the stops, and hauling on the steadying lines. When
the trestle-trees are as high up as possible on the cap, haul on the
steadying lines, and cut the stops close to the trestle-trees on the
starboard side, and the crosstrees will fall across the cap; then
place the after hole between the trestle-trees, over the round hole in
the cap--cast off the girtlines and steadying lines--white-lead the
mast-head in the wake of the crosstrees, and sway the topmast through;
beat the crosstrees well down on the mast-head; and when placed, sway
the topmast a few feet higher for rigging. Pass a lashing through the
fid-hole, and round the lower mast, to steady it.

The topmasts are sometimes fidded before rigging, to avoid the greater
strain upon the top tackles. If a topmast has only one sheave (like a
mizen topmast), it is a good precaution to reeve a hawser through the
fid-hole, and haul it taut, as the mast goes aloft; unreeving it only
when the mast is high enough for fidding, or previous to the squares
entering the trestle-trees.

[Illustration]

=115.=--PLACING TOPMAST RIGGING.

Tar the masthead in the wake of the rigging; send the bolsters aloft,
and stop them. After the bolsters are on, put over first the mast-head
pendants--then the span for ginn blocks; then follows the straps, with
thimble in for standing part of the tyes--next, first pair of shrouds
on the starboard side, then the larboard; and so on, until all are
over; then lash the breast backstay (if single); if a pair, put them
over the same as a shroud; next the after backstays; lash the stays,
if fitted for it, if not, put them over the same as lower stays, with
_mousings_. The collars of the stays go between the cross-trees, and
lash over the after one. Some prefer chain spans. The most approved
method is an iron plate, with a hook on each end, which lays across the
trestle-trees.

=116.=--TO SEIZE-IN THE SISTER-BLOCKS.

There is a score on each side to take the shroud, and three scores
for seizing--one on each end, and one between both sheaves. They are
seized-in the length of the hanging block, from the eye-seizing, to
prevent any risk of the reef-tackle and lift being jammed between
the hanging blocks and the rigging--one seizing is passed round the
shrouds, above the block, another below the block; and a small seizing
put on each score, round the block and shrouds. The topsail-lift leads
through the lower sheave, and reef tackle through the upper one.

The larboard block should be seized-in once the diameter of the shroud
lower than the other, as, if both are seized alike (the starboard
shroud going over first) they would not be square when the rigging is
placed.

=117.=--BACKSTAYS, (BREAST,)

When in pairs, are fitted with eyes, the same as the shrouds, and
served sufficiently far down to be square with the service of the
topmast shrouds. They are also parceled and served in the way of the
lower yards, when braced up. When there is only one backstay it is
secured round the mast-head with a lashing passed round it, through an
eye spliced in;[7] they are set up to a treble block in the channels.
Through these blocks a fall is rove, the standing part being spliced
into the strap of the double block, and then led from the treble block
through a fair leader in the side, in on deck.

_Note._--I have seen ships without breast backstays on any mast,
and they carried sail equally well with those who had them; one
was the _Independence razee_: her breast backstays were converted
into standing ones, and set up a little further aft, or immediately
forward of the proper standing backstays.

Breast backstays are generally pulled up in stays when the ship is
head to wind, having a quarter-watch of topmen stationed by them. If
they should be set up too taut, which may be the case, especially
when the rigging is slack, they are likely to snap and endanger the
mast by the sudden jerk; if not set up enough, they can be of no use,
and are only an additional weight on the mast-heads, and a useless
expenditure of rope. Their being set up to bear an equal strain with
the rigging, will not occur with the greatest care once in a year,
and I consider them particularly injurious on top-gallant-masts. A
good stout _standing backstay_ is the main support.

[7] Some are fitted with a cut splice.

=118.=--STANDING AFTER-BACKSTAYS,

When in pairs, are fitted with an eye the same as topmost rigging. When
an odd one on each side, they are fitted with a horse shoe. They are
now fitted the same size as lower rigging.

The backstays are set up with a lanyard rove through dead-eyes, the
same as shrouds, having service in the wake of the lower yards and tops.

=119.=--MAIN TOPMAST STAY

Is fitted of the same size as the standing backstay. A large clump
block is strapped round the foremast head, over the eyes of the
rigging, and immediately over the square hole in the after part of the
trestle-trees. Through this block the main topmast stay is rove down,
through the trestle-trees--has a thimble turned in the end, lanyard
spliced and rove through it, and set up to a span shackle in the deck,
abaft the foremast, for the purpose; or a large bull’s-eye hooked to an
eye-bolt, and set up on the end.

The spring stay leads through a block strapped round the foremast above
the cat-harpens, and sets up in the fore-top.

[Illustration]

=120.=--MIZEN TOPMAST STAY

Is rove through a thimble strapped round the mainmast-head, over the
eyes of the rigging; and when set up, is secured to its own part with
round seizings. If preferred, it can be set up with a thimble turned
into the end, and a lanyard rove through it; but this is not necessary.
When the stays are well stretched, the thimbles can be spliced in, but
it is not a good plan; for, should it be necessary to unreeve, the
splice must be drawn, which will injure the rope. I have seen them
fitted in this way, and pointed over for neatness,--but prefer their
being turned in, and the end pointed or capped.

_Note._--There is no mizen topmast spring-stay.

=121.=--GETTING THE TOPMAST CAPS ON.

The girtline blocks should be lashed well up to the topmast head.
Overhaul down before all the foremost ends, and secure them to the
foremost bolts in the cap; stop them to the centre ones, and also to
the square hole in the after part; sway the cap up;--when well up, cut
the after stops, sway higher, and the cap can be easily placed by the
man aloft, and girtlines cast off.

If the cap should be very heavy, use a derrick; a capstan bar will
answer the purpose.

_Note._--Ship the capshore the same time you place the cap.

=122.=--MAST-HEAD MAN ROPES, &c., &c.

A piece of rope has an eye spliced in one end, and several overhanded
knots made on the bight, at equal distances from each other. They
should be long enough to reach a third down the topmast rigging, and
seized round the mast-head close to the cap; one on each side is
sufficient. They are absolutely necessary in large ships, and should be
on all.

I have seen them in some very neat ships; and, when it is recollected
the small space the men have for their feet when they get near the
crosstrees, and the long mast-head, to get on the cap, it is certainly
worth while to sacrifice something in the way of appearance to ensure
the safety of a man’s life.

Some large ships have ladders with two steps, set up to the eyes of
the topmast rigging, from the cap; also, spans and grab-ropes fitted,
to go from the swifters abreast of the cap, which will be found very
convenient for the topmen, when exercising sails. These may appear
trifling matters to some, but ships fitted with them are generally
ahead, when exercising in a squadron.

=123.=--TOP TACKLE PENDANTS, &c.

When cut to the required length, a thimble, _well parceled_, is spliced
into one end, and the other pointed, with a becket in it. There are two
to the fore, and two to the main topmasts. In the heel of each topmast
there is a dumb sheave;--take one pendant and reeve it through the top
block, hooked to the cap, through the trestle-trees, through the dumb
sheave, or _heel-block_, through an eye-bolt in the foremost part of
the cap, on the opposite side to the block; take two half-hitches, and
secure the end to its own part, with a spun-yarn seizing; hook the top
tackle block to the thimble in the pendant, and the lower one, to a
bolt in the deck for the purpose; reeve the fall through a leader, and
bring it to the capstan; heave well taut, and unreeve the hawser by
which the mast was formerly hove up for rigging.

The other pendant reeves through the other top-block, through the
sheave hole in the topmast, and clenched to the other eye-bolt in the
fore corner of the cap; hook the blocks, reeve and bring the fall
to the capstan, taking the other off, and manning it well. When no
capstan, both falls must be well-manned by hand.

_Top Tackle Falls and Blocks._--The upper block is double, strapped,
which is made into a hook; the lower is also double, and should be
iron-strapped, having a swivel; a single one is hooked near the
double as a leading block; the fall is rove; the standing part
hitched, or clenched, over the block; they are sometimes spliced in,
and some have beckets.

To hook the double block, clap a single tail-block well up on the
pendant, reeve a whip through it, hitch one end of the whip through
one of the sheaves of the double block, hoist it up, and hook it to
the pendant.

=124.=--PREPARING TO FID THE TOPMASTS.

Capshores should be stepped and secured, luff tackles clapped on all
the stays and backstays. Lower blocks should not be hooked on to the
lanyards, but to bolts in the deck, and eye-bolts or straps in the
chains; capstans and falls manned, topmast rigging quite clear, and
hove over the sides of the tops, and the topmasts hove up and fidded,
_mast stayed_, _rigging set up_, _&c._

=125.=--RATTLING THE LOWER AND TOPMAST RIGGING.

Cat-harpen legs and futtock shrouds are seized-on and set up; topmast
stayed, rigging and backstays set up, lanyards secured as lower
rigging,--then commence rattling down.

Girt the rigging with three fore and aft swifters--one by the shear
rail, and the others at equal distances, as follows:--Make one end of a
small rope fast round the foremost shroud, take a turn round the next,
then the third, and so on, until all are taken in; then back the same
way, and half-hitch it round the first. The swifter should be just
taut, and not so as to bring the shrouds together,--the object being
to make the ratlines a little tauter when let go. Sometimes swifters
are not used, but the ratlines are never so square, or look well. Care
should be taken that they are not too taut, for, when let go, all the
strain will come on the seizing in the eyes of the ratlines, and they
will be constantly snapping. Two swifters on each side are sufficient
for the topmast rigging.

_Spar the rigging down_, with spare spars, such as studding-sail
yards, boat’s oars, boat’s masts, handspikes, or anything _light_ that
will answer, and seize them to the shrouds on the outside, at equal
distances, leaving sufficient space for three or four ratlines between
each spar.

A coil of small well-stretched rope is placed on each side of the deck,
two or three on a side when required to be done quick. Splice an eye in
one end of the rattling stuff, seize it to the first shroud, and then
commence clove-hitching on the second, and so on to the after, but one;
then measure the distance from that to the last, cut it off, and splice
an eye in the end. Beat the _hitches_ well round each shroud, seize the
end to the foremost one, and also the other eye to the after one, and
rattle up, taking the shear of the rails. The hitches are formed on the
outside, and at equal distances; in three or four places take a ratline
to the after swifter;--these are called _shear ratlines_.

When it is necessary to rattle quick, take three ends up at a time.
Fifteen inches is a good distance between the ratlines, and their
places should be chalked off all the way up and down before commencing.
Each man employed should have a measure within his reach, and care
should be taken to make the ratlines on one side correspond in a
parallel direction with those of the other. This can only be seen from
the outside of the ship. Make the hitches neat, and the eyes small; few
things tend more to a snug appearance.

If the rigging is to be blacked, after rattling down, it is best to
leave the spars on until that is done, taking them off as you black
down.

=126.=--FUTTOCK-STAVES IN TOPMAST RIGGING

Are iron bolts parceled and served; are seized to the shrouds the
length of the _hounds_, down on the inside; seizings passed as in lower
rigging.

_Cat-harpen legs on topmast rigging._--Take the length from the
starboard foremost shroud round the mast, and to the after one on
the same side; get a piece of rope this length, splice an eye in
each end, worm, parcel, and serve it. There are two on each mast.
Seize the foremost end to the foremost shroud and futtock stave, take
it round the mast and seize it to the after one; secure one to the
larboard side in the same manner.

I have seen them go from the foremost starboard shroud, straight to
the after larboard one, crossing abaft the mast. They are also fitted
to set up with thimbles and a lanyard, abaft the mast. When this is
done, both eyes are seized to the futtock staves on the starboard
side, a thimble seized in the bight, and set up abaft the mast to
the larboard one, with a lanyard fitted in the same way. (Vessels
with chain topsail ties are fitted with iron _bands_, to go round the
mast, with eyes for the topgallant rigging to lead through.)

=127.=--TO RIG THE JIB-BOOM.

Hoist the jib-boom on board by the hawser or tackle, which was left at
the foremast head when getting on board the fore topmast, run the end
out on the bowsprit, pointing it through the stays and bowsprit cap.
Reeve the heel-rope, and sway the jib-boom out a foot or two beyond the
cap. Reeve the jib-stay through the hanks, _traveller if required_, and
then through the inner sheave-hole, in the boom end, martingale and
necklace, and turn a double block in the inner end; reeve the lanyard
or fall through this, and a single block bolted to the bows. To the
traveler seize the jib downhaul blocks and traveling guys; tar the boom
end, put a grommet over, to which seize the fore topgallant bowline
blocks, one on each side.

_Foot ropes._--There is one on each side of the jib-boom. They should
be long enough when in their place to allow a man to stand navel-high
along the boom, and are fitted as follows: take a piece of rope long
enough to make both; cut it in the centre and splice one end into the
other with a cut splice, forming an eye to fit the jib-boom end. Four
or five overhand knots are taken at equal distances on the rope, from
the eye, according to the length of the foot-rope; the knots are for
the purpose of preventing the men from slipping. In each end splice a
small eye, large enough to take a lashing, by which they are set up
to bolts in the bowsprit cap. An eye is sometimes made by taking a
round turn round the boom end, and two seizings passed. Also with a
span, horse-shoe fashion, and neatly covered with canvass.

_Note._--Turk’s-heads worked through the strands, may be substituted
for knots on the foot-ropes, if time will permit.

=128.=--JIB-BOOM MARTINGALE STAY

Is a short rope, with an eye in each end to fit the jib-boom, and end
of the dolphin-striker. The eyes are well served, and covered with
canvass or leather. The martingale is wormed, and a small twine seizing
(snaked) put on round the worming at equal distances between the eyes;
three, or four, according to the length, which must depend on the way
the dolphin-striker is intended to stand, or rake. It looks best when
perpendicular to cap or jackstaff.

Chain is sometimes used for the purpose, as also for back-ropes; and is
found to answer well, it not being liable to stretch.

=129.=--JIB-BOOM GUYS.

There is one pair on each side; an eye is made to fit the boom end
by passing a round seizing, when in their place; both ends are rove
through thimbles on each yard-arm of spritsail yard (when crossed).
Then brought in and both ends set up to bull’s eyes in the bow, or
fitted with tackles.

_Placing the rigging on the jib-boom._--First, the foot-ropes; next,
the martingale stay, and guys. In some ships, an iron grummet is
fitted with an eye on top and one underneath, neatly leathered, and
put over the boom-end first. The martingale stay is hooked to the
underneath eye, the jib-tack and downhaul to the upper one.

=130.=--MARTINGALE BACK-ROPES

Are pendants, middled and served in the centre, the round of the
dolphin striker, both parts crossed and secured with a throat seizing.
The service should be long enough to take in the seizing. In the ends
splice a single or double block; another single one is strapped into a
bolt in the bow for the purpose, or fitted in a strap with a hook and
thimble (hook moused). A gun tackle, or luff-purchase, is then rove,
the standing part of the fall spliced round the pendant, in after end
of the block, rove through the one in the bow, over the head rails,
back through the one in the pendant, and through a fair leading sheave,
in the forecastle bulwark. These falls, after being pulled up, are
racked together outside the bulwark. If belayed on the forecastle, they
should be seized to their next part, so as not to be let go by mistake.

=131.=--PLACING THE RIGGING ON A DOLPHIN-STRIKER.

Back-ropes first, and next the martingale; below this rigging, in the
end of the dolphin-striker, are two or three sheaves, and one close
above it, large enough to admit the jib-stay, which is rove through
it; flying jib-stay in the next sheave, and flying martingale stay
under all, which will show two ropes leading from each boom end, to the
dolphin-striker.

=132.=--GETTING THE JIB-BOOM OUT.

The flying jib-boom iron is driven on; the heel rope manned (if
rigged), and the boom hauled out. The heel strap is placed in a score
in the heel for the purpose, and both bights lashed together; then
another lashing passed round the strap, between the boom and the
bowsprit, and the strap well frapped together. The heel being well
secured, set up the back ropes and guys.

_Note._--Rigging to be placed same as jib-boom.

=133.=--SENDING UP TOPGALLANT MASTS.

The topgallant top blocks being hooked, we will suppose the long mast
rope is to be rove, from the starboard side of the topmast-cap; take
the end through the square hole in the fore part of the trestle-trees,
half-hitch it through the fid-hole, and stop it round the _hounds_,
and the royal mast-head; send the hauling part through lubber’s hole,
and through a leading block or sheave on deck. The topgallant rigging
is fitted on a sheet-iron cylinder or funnel, attached to the jack
cross-trees (by an order from the former Navy Commissioners), leathered
and painted on the outside, and tarred on the inside; put on the
grommet or strap for the main royal stay[8] to reeve through, then put
on the topgallant and flying jib-stays, starboard and larboard shrouds,
breast and standing backstays, and secure them over the funnel;
overhaul the girtlines down on deck, and bend them on to the rigging,
around all parts, about the length of the mast-head below the jack, and
a good stop through the funnel; hoist the funnel up and place it, with
the rigging on, over the hole in the cap, and take the stays forward
and reeve them.

Man the mast-ropes and “sway away,” having men stationed to bear off
and place the rigging or funnel. When pointed through the funnel, place
the royal rigging and truck, reeve the signal halyards, and _attach_
the conductor; “sway higher,” land the mast on the top or forepart of
lower mast-cap, and, if required, reeve the short mast rope; reeve the
pointed end through a block hooked to the cap on the larboard side, or
the sheave, then through the trestle-trees, through the sheave-hole
in the topgallant-mast, up through the trestle-trees, and secure the
end to the foremost bolt in the cap, with two half-hitches, and seize
the end; to the thimble in the other end, hook the double block of a
burton; hook the single one to a strap round the trestle-trees; send
the burton fall on deck through lubber’s hole, and lead it through a
single leading block, and haul it taut; unreeve the long mast rope,
and fid the mast; when the fid is in, the mast rope can be unrove, if
wished.

Reeve the ends of the shrouds through the horns of the cross-trees,
between the topmast rigging, over the futtock staves, and turn a
thimble in each end; strap another round a futtock plate, inside the
dead-eyes of top-mast rigging; if there is none placed in the top,
splice a lanyard into that in each shroud, and take two or three turns
through each, stay the mast, and set the rigging and backstays up.

In setting up the backstays the single block of the jigger, which is
hooked to the thimble, is hooked to a blackwall hitch, in the lanyard,
and when set up, expend the lanyard through the thimbles, and seize
the ends. On both shrouds on each side clap on small jiggers, hook the
double blocks to straps on the shrouds, the single to Blackwall hitches
in the lanyards, and set up and secure the same as the backstays.

The fore topgallant stay reeves through the outer sheave-hole in the
jib-boom, and through a bull’s-eye hooked to the bows, and when set up,
is seized to its own part.

The main topgallant stay is rove through the middle sheave in the after
chock of the fore topmast crosstrees, or through a block strapped
around the fore mast-head, and set up in the fore top.

The mizen topgallant stay is rove through a bull’s-eye in the after
part of the main cap, and set up in the main top.

[8] Suppose this to be the fore topgallant-mast.

=134.=--ROYAL RIGGING.

There is one breast, and after backstay on each side, seized as the
after backstays on topgallant masts. The breast backstay or _shroud_,
is pulled up with a gun tackle purchase;[9] the after leg has a thimble
turned in, and sets up in the after part of the chains, with a lanyard.

_Royal stays._--As there is no funnel (although it would be a
great advantage to have one), splice an eye in the stay to fit the
mast-head, cover it, and serve over the splice. It goes on next to
the grommet, then the shroud and backstays, spanned together.

The fore royal stay is rove through the outer sheave-hole in the
flying jib-boom end, and pulled up through a fair leader on the
forecastle.

The main royal stay is rove through a thimble stopped around the
foretop gallant mast-head, through another strapped round the eye of
a shroud, and when set up is seized to its own part.

Mizen royal stay reeves through a sheave in the after part of the
main topmast trestle-trees, through a thimble strapped round the eye
of a main shroud, and seized to its own part.

[9] Royal-backstays are set up with a jigger to their respective
places in the channels. The shrouds are set up in the top
breast-backstay-fashion.

=135.=--SHORT AND LONG TOPGALLANT MAST-ROPES.

_Short mast ropes_ have a thimble spliced in one end, and the other
end pointed. They are rove when the mast is rigged, and are used for
fidding. They should be sufficiently long (when the mast is landed on
the top or cap), after being rove through the block and sheave in the
heel of the mast, and clenched to the cap, to allow the thimble to hang
clear of the cat-harpen legs.

If the topsail-yard is crossed, the mast is landed on it, for rigging;
if the topgallant-mast should be too long to allow its being landed on
the yard, the mast rope must be lengthened accordingly.

_Long mast ropes._--Ropes are often fitted for the purpose; but the
topgallant yard rope is generally used. I have seen them fitted as
follows, and they answered very well:--

The rope is rove, and stopped to the topgallant-masthead, and royal
sheave-hole, leaving a long end over the upper stop, to hitch to the
bolt, before cutting the stops. To prevent the rope _slipping_, rack
both parts together above the sheave-hole in the heel of the mast.

=136.=--TO RIG THE FLYING JIB-BOOM.

Sway it on board and point it through the iron at the jib-boom end. A
tail block is put on the neck of the iron, or on the jib-stay, close
down to the boom. Through this block reeve the heel rope, one end taken
in on the forecastle, and the other bent to the heel of the boom.
A rope is bent to the heel of the boom to serve as a guy; sway the
boom out a foot or two for rigging. Put over the foot ropes, fitted
as the jib-boom, the inner ends seized to the jib-boom end, inside
the iron. The martingale, when single, is secured round the boom end,
clenched, spliced, or with a running eye, rove through a sheave in the
dolphin-striker, and in on the forecastle, on the opposite side to the
royal stay. When double, a single block is strapped round the boom end,
and the standing part spliced round the dolphin-striker; hauling part
as when single.

_Guys._--One on each side spliced into each other, forming a
cut-splice to fit the boom end. The other end rove through thimbles,
strapped round the spritsail yard, through fair leaders in the
bulwarks, and pulled up on the forecastle, or set up on the bows.

Man the heel rope and get the boom out; the heel is placed in a
step formed on the fore side of the bowsprit cap, for the purpose,
and secured with a lashing, rove through the end, and passed round
the jib-boom. Set up the martingale, stay the fore topgallant and
royal mast, (fore and aft,) by the stays and backstays; and if the
spritsail yard is crossed, reeve the guys, turn in thimbles, and set
them up.

=137.=--SPRITSAIL LIFTS

Are single; have an eye spliced in one end to fit the yard-arm; splices
served over are taken over the jib guys, rove through the bull’s-eye in
the cap, and set up on the forecastle. Blocks are sometimes strapped
into the bolts, but it is quite unnecessary. Bolts are often driven
into the fore side of the cap, and the lifts led through; when this
is done, they are generally set up there with lanyards and thimbles,
spliced into the end, which answers every purpose.

=138.=--SPRITSAIL BRACES.

A single block is strapped into a bolt in the cheek of the foremast on
each side. The brace has an eye in one end, to fit the yard arm; the
other is rove through the single block, on collar of fore-stay, and
another single block is spliced into the end; a luff tackle purchase is
rove with it, and a double block on the deck, one sheave answering for
a leading one.

They are sometimes rove double, but the practice is getting out of date.

=139.=--STRAPPING THIMBLES FOR GUYS ON SPRITSAIL YARDS.

The thimbles are double-strapped and secured, after being placed round
the yard, and in the score of the thimbles, with a round seizing passed
between the thimble and the yard; the splices laying in the upper side
of the score in the thimbles. Some fit grummet straps, or a short-long
splice, in the strap for neatness.

The use of double straps is to allow the thimbles to lay fair with the
yard for the jib guys to lead through; if single, they would stand fore
and aft.

=140.=--CROSSING A SPRITSAIL YARD.

The yard being rigged, prepare for crossing as follows:

Clap a good selvagee strap well up, on the fore topmast stay; to it
hook a snatch or leading block large enough to take a hawser; reeve
it and timber-hitch it round the starboard quarter of the spritsail
yard, (if got out on the starboard side,) stop it along to the larboard
quarter, and half way out on the larboard yard-arm. Overhaul down the
lifts and braces, and sway out, keeping the larboard yard-arm under
the bowsprit; when clear on the larboard side, put over the brace, or
block, and lift, and haul out; when nearly out, or before clear of
the head rails, put over the starboard brace or block and lift; haul
on the hawser, starboard lift, and brace, and cast off the stops.
When sufficiently out, pass the parrel, _take a turn or hold well on
the end_; hook the tye, and square the yard. Cast off the hawser and
unreeve it; reeve the jib-guys through their thimbles on the spritsail
yard, turn in dead-eyes or blocks, and set them up to others on the
bows; set all up taut and square the yard.

=141.=--TWO HALF SPRITSAIL YARDS.

Two half spritsail yards, made like dolphin-strikers, are secured to
the bowsprit with jaws, (or an iron band fitted round the bowsprit,
with a double goose-neck hinge,) to cant or turn in any required
direction. When the half spritsail yard is carried it is rigged as
follows:--

The fore guys are made of well stretched rope, and equal in strength to
the jib guys together, each fitted with an artificial eye to fit the
jib-boom end and half yard-arm. They should be wormed with small rope,
parceled and served, or covered in the eyes; four stranded rope is
preferable, it being not so liable to stretch as three.

The after guys are fitted with an artificial eye in one end, to fit the
yard arm, and a thimble spliced into the other. They are the same size
as the fore guys, and wormed in the same manner. If made on purpose,
and four-stranded, the thimble is kept in the bight with a round
seizing.

The jumper, or lower guy, is fitted the same as the after, only
shorter; the length of this depends on the drop intended to be given to
the yard arm, which should never be less than the spritsail yard, when
well braced up, or, in other words, _canted_.

The jumper is put on the yard arm first, then the after one, next, the
foremost, and over the jib-boom. The after one is set up to a bolt by
the cat-head, well down; the lower, to an eye-bolt in each side of the
cutwater, well out.

For a frigate, the guys are eight-and-a-half-inch, and wormed with
twenty-one thread stuff. Four-stranded rope, if made on purpose, can
have the eyes formed when laying up in the rope walk. Some fit forward
and after guys all in one.

=142.=--WHISKERS.

Whiskers are iron outriggers from the cathead, with sheaves in them for
the guys to reeve through, and set up to the fore chains, the same as
when rove through the spritsail yard. This plan is much in use in small
vessels, but the boom is supported almost entirely by the martingale,
as the guys being considerably above the boom, and its always _topping
up_, when the sail is set on a wind, the more wind the greater the
strain on the martingale; and should the guys be not carefully pulled
up, the boom must depend on the martingale entirely for support.

=143.=--TO GET ON BOARD AND RIG LOWER YARDS.

Overhaul the hawser from the lower mast-head, bend on to the slings
of the yard, and get them nearly up and down; clap selvagees on the
quarters, to which hook the pendant tackles. As it comes on board, cut
the stops, easing away on the pendant tackle, and bousing on the other,
until the yard is athwart-ships; place chocks in the hammock nettings
for the yard to rest on; slue them fair, and lash them; come up the
tackles, cast off the hawsers, and place a shore under the middle of
the yard to prevent its springing. Measure the yard, tar and leather
the slings, fit a saddle for the D thimble, which lash on with a piece
of well stretched rope, heaving each turn taut with a Spanish windlass,
and fitting the score of the D thimble. Cover all with leather, and fit
the straps for the preventer slings, &c., &c., &c.

_Note._--The iron sling-bands are now used instead of the _old
fashioned_ D thimble.

Chain is now generally used, and allowed to all ships in the service
for the slings (proper), rope ones being used as preventers. (See
Rigging Table.)

=144.=--TRUSS STRAPS.

A large thimble with the score well parceled, is seized into a double
strap, which is made by splicing both ends together, and served over;
the thimble secured in the strap with a round seizing, the splice
laying in the score. The strap should be long enough to go round the
yard in the quarter, both eyes lashing together on the fore side. There
are two on each yard. One thimble is seized inside the truss pendant,
the other outside; and one in the round of the pendant higher up than
the other.

=145.=--TRUSS PENDANTS[10]

Are wormed, parceled, and served; an eye is spliced in one end large
enough to take the pendant when rove through it; in the other an
artificial eye is made, large enough to take the single block for truss
fall. The pendant should be rove through the small eye before the
artificial one is made, boused well taut round the yard, the eye being
kept underneath, and one pendant higher than the other. Reeve the upper
pendant through the upper thimble, and lower pendant through lower
thimble. Being rove in this manner, they will lead perfectly clear of
each other.

_Hide rope_ is preferable for pendants, but the iron patent truss is
now allowed to all vessels, up to a second class frigate inclusive.
(_New regulation_).

[10] For length and size, see Rigging Table.

=146.=--QUARTER BLOCKS--LOWER YARDS.

Quarter or topsail sheet blocks are large single blocks, with double
straps; the block seized in with a round seizing, and secured round
the yard, (inside the cleat, one on each side,) with a rose-lashing
passed through both bights on the top of the yard. Before the lashing
is passed, the block should be hove up with heavers, and the eyes of
the strap brought as close together as possible. This is done with a
good strand passed through both, and hove up with a Spanish windlass.
Vessels carrying chain topsail sheets, have iron blocks fitted to the
iron bands in the slings of the yard for that purpose. (See Rigging
Table).

=147.=--CLEW GARNET BLOCKS

Are single; seized into a single strap, with an eye spliced in each
end, and are secured round the yard with a rose-lashing, the same as
the topsail sheet blocks, just outside the cleats. Some ships have all
the rigging inside the cleats, which is much neater.

_Note._-Iron bound blocks are allowed to all classes of vessels in
the navy, by the new regulation, for this purpose.

=148.=--LIFT BLOCKS--LOWER YARDS

Are single, seized into a single strap, with a round seizing; the strap
being long enough to go over the yard arm, after the block is seized
in. If both ends are spliced together, the splice should lay in the
score of the block, or upper side; but a grummet will answer equally as
well, and look snugger.

=149.=--FOOT ROPES AND STIRRUPS.

The foot ropes are cut once-and-a-half the length of the yard,
(excepting lower yards). An eye, to fit the yard arm, is spliced in one
end; and a small one, to take a seizing, in the other. The splicing
served in the way of chafing (one-third) midship part.

_Stirrups_ are short pieces of rope spliced round the foot rope; eyes
spliced in the opposite ends, to go over the jackstay-bolts; splices
served over. They are sometimes unlaid at one end and made into plait,
and secured to the yard with flat-headed nails, having a small piece of
hide or leather placed under their heads before being driven into the
yard. Going over the jackstay bolts is preferable; and some seize it
to the neck of the bolt, or staple. They hang on the after side of all
yards.

Some vessels have their foot ropes fitted to go abaft the mast, and
seized to the parrel, which answers a very good purpose, especially in
vessels with raking masts, as it gives the men a better opportunity to
stand.

=150.=--JACKSTAYS.--BENDING AND REEFING.

Take a piece of rope of the proper size,[11] cut off the length of the
yard, splice an eye in each end, to fit the yard arm, sufficiently taut
to require being driven on. Cut in the centre, and splice a thimble in
each end; put the strands for splicing in once-and-a-half, marl down,
and serve over. If two jackstays on each arm, (which should always
be the case when the sail is reefed to one), the large one, before
splicing the thimbles in, is rove through the eye-bolts on the yard for
the purpose; this is the reefing jackstay. The bending one is fitted
the same way, and after being put over the yard arm, is seized to the
neck of the bolts on the after side.

This plan has been generally adopted, as it was found much easier to
reef, than when fitted with only one jackstay; there being always
difficulty and delay in getting the points between the jackstay and the
yard, when the sail was bent to it. When only one jackstay, it is rove
through the eye-bolts.

_Note._--Iron bending jackstays are now allowed for all vessels in
the navy.

[11] For the length and size of rope, see Rigging Table.

=151.=--BRACE BLOCKS.--LOWER YARDS.

The straps should be fitted sufficiently taut to require being driven
on the yard arm. Two thimbles are fitted, one within the other, called
_lock thimbles_. Take a piece of rope, of the proper size, and cut
it long enough to go round one thimble and the yard, when spliced
together; worm, parcel and serve it, and pass a round seizing round
this strap, close to the thimble. Grommet straps are preferable, if
time will permit.

The block is a large single one, with two scores. For the strap take
a piece of rope the required length, and splice both ends together;
worm, parcel, and serve it; reeve it through the thimble already
strapped, and pass both parts round the score of the other thimble;
then place both bights in the scores in the brace block, keeping the
splice in the after end of the block; pass a round seizing between the
block and thimble, crossing it both ways, as in a double strap.

_Cross-jack brace-blocks_ are single, and strapped the same as lower
ones. A double block is secured to the after shrouds in the main
rigging, the same as main preventer brace blocks. When reeving the
cross-jack braces, one end of the brace is clinched, spliced, or
half-hitched, and the end seized, just below the block; then rove
through the block on the yard, through the inside sheave in double
block, and through a fair leading sheave in a rack, in the side or a
leading block. I have seen blocks strapped into bolts on the main-mast,
for the brace and bowline, which answered well. The brace block should
be put on the yard, sufficiently far in to be inside the topmast
backstays, when braced up.

_Note._--These braces should be well _below_ the yard, as it always
_tops up_ on the wind, which slacks the weather leech; this is partly
the reason a mizen-topsail never stands well.

=152.=--PLACING THE RIGGING ON LOWER YARDS.

Sling bands in the centre, and also on both sides, close to the topsail
sheet block, the truss pendants, then truss straps; if the rigging is
all within the cleats, a clue garnet block is lashed on each side; if
not, they are lashed one on each side, close outside. I have seen them
both ways, but inside is preferable.

Tar well the yard arm, close to the cleats and slings, in the wake of
the rigging, first jackstay; if two, the bending one, and set it up
amidships with a lanyard. Then the foot ropes; after going over the
yard arm, and rove through the stirrups, they are lashed together,
with a lanyard rove through both thimbles, and are secured with a good
seizing to the strap of quarter block. Then the brace, and lift blocks.
Rolling tackle straps on the inner quarter of yard, with the eye abaft
burton straps on the outer quarter yard-arm, eye on top of yard.

If the stirrups go over the jackstay bolts, they should be put over
before the jackstay is rove.

The cross jack-yard has no jackstay, head earings, or yard tackle
straps; and the brace blocks, instead of going over the yard-arm, are
put on some distance inside of the sheave hole for the mizen-topsail
sheets, on the forward side of the yard.

=153.=--GETTING UP JEER-BLOCKS, AND REEVING JEERS.

Secure two single whip blocks to the after bolts in lower cap. Send the
two foremost ends through lubber’s hole down on deck; bend them through
the shell of the block, with two half-hitches, and seize the end. Stop
them along each leg of the strap, the larboard whip to the larboard
leg, and the starboard whip to the starboard leg; then stop both legs
together with a seizing of spun-yarn in the bights--the hauling part of
the whips being through lubber’s hole and through a leading block on
deck; man them and hoist the blocks into their places. When clear of
the top, cut the stop in the bights, haul on the whips, and they will
bring the strap into its place, on each side of the mast-head. Then cut
the upper stops, on the whips; take a turn and pass the lashing in the
bight, securing each end to their next part. When secured, let go, and
take off the whips.

_Reeving jeers._--The standing part is clenched round the strap of
the upper block, rove through the one on the yard, up through another
sheave in upper block, and so on, until all rove full. The hauling
part is rove through a leading sheave, in fore or main bitts, or
through leading blocks. When heaving up, they are either brought to
the capstan, or manned by hand.

The jeer blocks are now generally fitted with hooks, as they can be
got up and down much quicker. At the present day, few ships are seen
to carry their jeers up in their proper places.

=154.=--LOWER LIFT BLOCKS

Are double; an iron plate is bolted across the upper side of the main
or fore cap; it is in the form of a crescent, with the hollow side
toward the topmast. In each end of the crescent, or horn, an eye is
turned and a thimble put in it. Instead of the eyes being turned,
I have seen two eye-bolts driven through the crescent and cap, and
secured underneath with a nut; a thimble is also put in the eye-bolt,
and the blocks strapped in.

The cross-jack lift blocks are single, one on each side, and can be
fitted as the fore or main, or (a chalk) abaft the mast-head, if
preferred, for neatness.

=155.=--REEVING LOWER LIFTS.

Clench one end round the yard outside all, then take the other end up
and reeve it through the foremast sheave in the double block in the
fore or main cap, then through the block on the yard, through the other
sheave in the double block, and through lubber’s hole on deck; well up
this part, splice a lizard for jigger tackle, or use tails selvageed on
the end. The upper block of the jigger can be spliced or turned in to
the lift, if preferred.

The cross jack lifts go over the yard arms with an eye spliced in the
end to fit them. The other end is rove through the block at the cap,
and is set up with two thimbles and a lanyard in the top; one thimble
being turned into the end, the other strapped to the eye of one of the
lower shrouds.

=156.=--MAIN BRACES--ON BUMKIN, &c.

A single block is seized into a double strap, with a round seizing
crossed both ways; the strap is then put over an iron outrigger, or
bumkin on the quarters, fitted for the purpose. The standing part of
the brace being parceled, is rove through another bolt in the bumkin,
and spliced into it or clenched; the other end rove through the block
on the yard arm, from out, in through the block in the bumkin, and
through a sheave in the bulwarks (abaft), for the purpose.

Double blocks are sometimes put on the bumpkin, instead of single ones,
and also two sheaves inserted in the bulwarks instead of one, both ends
of the brace rove, and led in-board--_a great facility in working ship_.

=157.=--FORE BRACES

Are clove-hitched, and the end seized aft on the collar of the main
stay, below the splice; the other end taken forward and rove from in,
out, through the block on the yard, through a single block strapped
into a bolt in the cheek of the main-mast, with a thimble in it, close
up to the trestle-trees; then rove from forward aft, through a sheave
in the main fife-rail.

The brace is often middled, and clove-hitched in the bight on the main
stay, and both ends taken forward and rove as before. Some have a hole
bored in the bibs, or cheeks of the mast, instead of clove-hitching it
around the main stay.

=158.=--CROSSING THE LOWER YARDS.

The jeers being rove, reeve the pendants and falls, hitch the pendants
around the quarters of the yard, splice in the lanyard of the D
thimble, and take the yard tackles forward to keep the yard clear of
the mast. The lifts and braces being rove, man the lifts and jeer
falls, “sway away,” and when the yard comes abreast of the futtock
staves, pass the lashing of the D thimble, parcel it well, over all,
frap all parts together, and cover all with canvass; reeve the truss
pendants, turn in the blocks, reeve the falls, haul taut the tresses,
and square the yard by the lifts and braces.

=159.=--TO GET ON BOARD THE TOPSAIL YARDS.

A large single block is lashed to the topmast-head, through which a
hawser is rove; overhaul it down forward and hitch it to the slings of
the yard, stop it along the yard arm, and sway it on board. Cast off
the hawser, middle the yard and prepare it for rigging.

=160.=--RIGGING TOPSAIL YARDS. (FORE AND MAIN.)

[Illustration]

The jackstays, after going over the yard arm, are rove through the
eye-bolts or staples, and set up a-midships with a lanyard and thimble
spliced in.

Foot ropes round the yard abaft, on their opposite quarters, as
follows:--splice the lanyard into the eye in the end; take it over the
yard, and round on the fore side, underneath through the eye; again
back round the yard on the fore side, through the eye, and back the
same way, until sufficient turns are taken to secure it. Then take
a half-hitch from the lower edge of the eye, round all parts of the
lashing; pass it round before; reeve through the eye on the upper side,
take two half-hitches round all, and secure the end.

Tye blocks are now generally iron-strapped, and bolted into _straps_
round the yard for the purpose. If fitted with rope, they must have
double straps, and secured round the yard, on the upper foremost
quarter, with a rose-lashing. If they are single blocks, two on each
yard.

Quarter blocks are double blocks, iron strapped, and secured in the
same way as tye blocks. Much time is saved by having them fitted in
this manner, as in shifting yards, the topgallant sheets, and topsail
clewlines need not be unrove, which must be the case if rope-strapped.
If rope-strapped they are seized into a single strap, and lashed on top
of the yard with a rose-lashing.

_Parrel._--Take two pieces of rope, one longer than the other; the
long one of sufficient length to go round the mast and yard on each
side; the short leg to go round the mast, and lash to the long leg
on each side. An eye is spliced in each end, are wormed, parceled,
and served; both marled together and covered with leather. A round
seizing is passed around both, close to the eye of the short leg, on
each side. The long leg is taken round the yard, brought round on the
fore side, and secured to the short leg with a lashing of small rope,
passed through both eyes. The other eyes are lashed together when the
yard is across.

Brace blocks are strapped in the same way as fore or main yard.

Flemish horse is a short piece of rope spliced round a thimble, which
is on the neck of the pacific-iron,[12] it has an eye spliced in the
other end, and when the yard is rigged, is secured the same as a foot
rope, just inside the brace block, two or three feet, according to
the length of the yard. They should be long enough to allow a man to
stand on them to pass an earing, &c. They are sometimes fitted to
lower and top-gallant yards, for the convenience of reefing, &c.

Jewel-blocks are single blocks, seized into a strap put over a
thimble on the neck of the pacific-iron, outside the thimble for the
Flemish horse. Some fit them to go over the yard arm. Others fit them
with sister hooks, to hook to the pacific iron.

_Straps._--Half way out, on each yard arm, a strap is fitted long
enough to allow a thimble to be secured in it, with a seizing passed
between the yard and thimble,--this is called a rolling tackle
strap. Also, straps are put on the yard, with thimbles seized in the
same way, inside the lift, to hook a burton to; but a selvagee strap
is generally used for that purpose.

[12] Is what the boom-iron ships on.

=161.=--THE MIZEN TOPSAIL YARD

Is rigged nearly the same as the others, but the brace blocks are on
the fore-side, and the Flemish horses generally spliced into bolts in
the ends of the yards, with round thimbles in them. There is seldom
more than one tye-block on this yard, and no jewel blocks.

=162.=--PLACING THE RIGGING ON TOPSAIL YARDS.

Tar the yard arms; first the jackstay, foot ropes, brace, and lift
block; if no lift block, the lift; Flemish horses, and jewel-blocks.
The quarter blocks should be lashed so as to hang clear of the cap,
when the yard is down. See that the boom irons go on, and a small
cleat, or saddle, inside of the sheave hole, about two feet on each
yard-arm, to keep the topgallant sheets clear of the yard. Also reefing
cleats on yard-arms, outside the lift.

=163.=--CROSSING THE TOPSAIL YARDS.

Reeve a hawser through one of the hanging blocks; send one end down
before all, the other through lubber’s hole, and through a leading
block on deck. Take a round turn, and timber-hitch the hawser round
the slings of the yard; stop it along the larboard yard-arm, if got up
on the starboard side; if got up on the larboard side, the contrary.
Overhaul well down to main or fore rigging, the starboard lifts and
braces; the larboard into the top, and stop them ready for rigging. Man
the hawser, and “sway away.” When the upper yard arm is clear of the
top, put over the brace and lift, (or block,) and “sway higher;” rig
the lower yard arm, take in the slack of the lifts and braces, then
cast off the stops on the upper yard-arm, and when the yard is well up,
take two or three turns with the parrel-lashing; bouse well up on the
starboard or lower lifts, overhaul the larboard, and the stops being
cast off, the yard will fall across. Secure the parrel; square the yard
by braces and lifts, and cast off and unreeve the hawser.

_Note._--In large ships the lifts and brace blocks are generally
placed on the yard arms before the yard is sent aloft. The braces are
rove when the yard goes up. I would also recommend double yard ropes
in heavy ships in crossing topsail yards; also to use the burtons.

=164.=--FITTING FLY-BLOCKS FOR TOPSAIL HALLIARDS.

The blocks spliced into the tyes are so called. They are large flat
blocks; some double, sometimes single, and often one double and one
single to each. The tyes are sometimes spliced taut round them; but
this way is bad; as the rope stretches, the blocks cant, and are
split. Also a long-eye is sometimes made in the end of the tye, and
the fly block kept in its place by a round seizing passed close above
the block. The block in general use is seized into a strap, leaving
sufficient space above to splice the tye in; or a thimble spliced into
the end of the tye, and the fly block strapped with a pair of sister
hooks, to hook to the tyes. Either of the latter ways are preferable to
the former.

When the yard is on the cap, these blocks should be square with the
top rails. Before turning in and setting up for a full due, an iron
traveler is put on the topmast backstay, which is seized to the
fly-block,--it prevents the block from striking or injuring the top
when lowering; it also keeps the turns out of the halliards. There is
sometimes a traveling jackstay fitted for this purpose.

_Reeving Topsail Halliards._--When rove double, a single block is
strapped into, or hooked, to a swivel bolt in the after part of the
chains; one end of the halliards is spliced into the upper part of
the strap of this block, or bent into a becket put there for the
purpose, and the end seized. The other end is then rove through one
of the sheaves in the double block in the tye, then through the
sheave in the single block in the chains, through the other sheave in
the double block, and through a leading block on deck.

_The Mizen Topsail Halliards_ have only one tye. The standing part
is clenched or half-hitched to the strap, with the thimble, at the
mizen-topmast head, and a single block spliced or secured in the
end. Another single block is strapped into a swivel bolt in the mizen
chains, and the halliards rove as with two single blocks; the fall
rove through a leading block or cheek. (Some ships have a treble fly
block).

=165.=--RIGGING TOPGALLANT YARDS.

They are got on board like the topsail yards. Leather the slings,
seize-on the D thimble, parrel, and quarter blocks, rolling
tackle straps,--tar the yard arms--foot ropes the same as topsail
yards--stirrups one to each foot rope--iron jackstays secured to the
yard with staples, fitted the same way as rope. (Iron sling-bands are
allowed by the _new regulation_.)

The lifts are single; an eye is spliced to fit the yard-arm; the other
end is rove through the thimble, or bull’s-eye, or a half sister-block
in the topgallant-rigging; a thimble turned into the end, and a lanyard
spliced into it, and set up to another thimble strapped round a futtock
plate inside the dead-eye in the top, or set up on the end.

[Illustration]

_Braces._--A single block is seized into a single strap, having an
eye to fit the yard-arm. If a single brace, an eye is spliced to fit
the yard-arm, and the lift and brace marled together.

The quarter-blocks are double; are seized into a single strap, an
eye being spliced in each end;--they lash together on the top of the
yard--the foremost sheave for top-gallant clewline, after one for
royal sheet.

_Parrel._--A long and short leg. Take a piece of rope, cut it the
required length, and splice the ends together round the yard. In one
bight seize a thimble, with a round seizing; the other one round the
yard; pass a round seizing close to the yard, round the parrel on the
after side; splice a lanyard into the thimble, and fit a short strap
the same way on the other quarter. These straps are sometimes served,
and often covered with leather,--they go inside the cleats. Grommets
can be worked if preferred, and dispense with the thimbles, as they
are likely to injure the mast. Jaws are also recommended. The patent
iron parrels are now in use in the navy, but are found not to answer
for ships of war.

Tripping beckets are fitted one on each yard-arm; work grummet straps
on quarter of yard, seize a thimble in with a round seizing passed
between the yard and thimble. A grommet is put on the yard rope, to
fit the yard-arm, when getting ready for crossing. Also, a lizard;
a small piece of rope with a thimble spliced in one end, the other
whipped. It goes on the yard rope before being bent to the yard.

When ready for going aloft, the yard rope is bent on, and the yard
stopped to the lower rigging; the main on the starboard side, fore
and mizen on the larboard side.

_Note._--Royal yards, opposite sides, to the topgallant yards.

=166.=--TOPGALLANT BRACES.

_Fore._--If double, the standing part is clove-hitched round the first
and second shrouds of the main topmast rigging; or crotch of the stay,
through the block for the brace, through another single tail block,
secured to the first and second shrouds (the same as, and under the
standing part), through lubber’s hole, and through a fair leading
sheave on deck.

They are often led forward from the blocks in the topmast rigging,
through a leading block strapped round the eyes of the fore rigging,
or after part of the top, and through fair leading sheaves on the
forecastle. In ships of war, I prefer them abaft. The block in the
topmast rigging is fitted as follows:--

A single piece of rope is spliced round a single block, having a tail
about three or four feet long; clove-hitch this tail round the first
shroud, then round the second, and seize the end. I have seen a round
turn taken round the first, and a clove-hitch round the second; either
plan will do, but if neatness is studied, clove-hitch round the second
and third; this will bring the block under the rigging, and out of
sight. If rove single, the block is secured the same way--an eye made
in the end of the brace to fit the yard-arm; the other end rove through
the block on deck, as before.

A whip is sometimes put on the brace, the block spliced in close up
to the cat-harpens, which answers very well. One end of the whip is
spliced into a bolt on deck, the other led through a fair leading
sheave or block.

_Main._--The main topgallant braces are fitted the same as the
fore, with the exception of leading. The standing part is secured
in the same manner to the foremost, or second and third shrouds of
mizen-topmast rigging; the hauling part before all, through lubber’s
hole, and through a sheave in the rack, or a leading block, to the
side abreast of the mizen-mast.

_Mizen._--The mizen topgallant braces are single. An eye is spliced
in one end to fit the yard-arm. The other end is rove through a
single block; seized into a single strap, and secured to an eye-bolt
on each side of the main cap, and through lubber’s hole on deck. I
have seen these braces led through blocks in main topmast rigging, in
harbor, where appearance has been much studied.

=167.=--CROSSING TOPGALLANT YARDS.

One man stands on the topmast cap; two on the crosstrees (one on each
side), one of the latter shoves off the grommet, and rigs the upper
yard-arm; the man on the opposite side bears off,--one man stands in
the topmast rigging to put on the lower lift and brace; another stands
on the topsail yard, ready to bear off; the lower lift should be well
manned in the top.

When the order “sway out of the chains,” is given, the man standing on
the fore part of the top bears the yard rope off, to clear the yard-arm
of the top--when clear, “sway away.” When the yard-arm is clear of the
crosstrees, the grommet is shoved off, the upper lift and brace is put
on, and the order “sway higher” is given; then the lower lift and brace
is put on, and the lift hauled well taut. The man on the cap has the
parrel-lashing in his hand, ready for passing; he reeves a turn, and
on the order, “sway cross,” he hauls on the lizard. The lower lift is
boused on, and the yard falls across; the braces are hauled taut, and
the yard squared.

When a ship is going to sea, the lifts and braces are stopt to the
jackstay, and the topgallant yard ropes toggled for halliards, or
half-hitched over the upper block. To toggle the halliards: Strap two
single blocks, with single straps, leaving an eye below the seizing,
in one, to take a small lashing; in the other to take the bight of the
topgallant yard rope. Lash the block with the small eye, to the eye of
a lower shroud, and reeve the yard rope through it. To the strap of the
other block secure the toggle with a nettle lanyard.

_Note._--Separate halliards may be fitted to dog on to the yard rope,
with a double-tailed lizard, and hook the lower block to an eye-bolt
in the top, which answers a better purpose.

[Illustration]

=168.=--ROYAL YARDS

Are fitted the same as topgallant yards, and rigged the same, with the
exception of the quarter blocks, which are single. In small vessels
they have no jackstay, the sail being bent to the yard. Topgallant
sails are often bent the same way, but jackstays keep the sail much
better up on the yard. Some prefer a wooden batten nailed to the
yard. Iron jackstays are now used for all vessels in the navy. (_New
Regulation._)

_Fore Royal Braces._--Two blocks fitted in one strap, as span blocks,
are lashed round the main topgallant mast-head; the blocks standing
on the foremost quarter, on each side. Between the after part of the
fore topmast trestle-trees, _a piece of wood with two sheaves_, the
same size, and a large one in the centre, is secured.[13] The braces
are single, an eye is spliced in one end to fit the royal yard-arm;
the other end rove through the span-blocks, back again through the
sheaves in the fore topmast trestle-trees, and into the fore top.

The blocks are often strapped separately, and seized into the strap
with a round seizing, leaving room for a seizing to be passed through
the strap, and round the eye of the topgallant stay, before going
on the funnel, one on each side. This will not look so neat as span
blocks, and are not so easily taken off and put on. The blocks for
royal braces are often seized on the topgallant stay, with the idea
of clearing the foot of the main royal.

_Main royal braces_ are fitted in the same manner as the fore, and
led through single blocks on mizen-topgallant mast-head, and back
into the main top; or through lubber’s hole in the mizen-top on deck.
The latter is decidedly the best plan, as they can be much better
attended to when under the eye of the officer of the watch, than when
left to the topmen.

_Mizen royal braces_ are fitted the same as the others, and lead
through sheaves in the after ends of the main topmast crosstrees, and
into the top.

_Crossing royal yards._--They are crossed the same as the topgallant
yards. When they are rigged aloft, the topgallant masts should be
fitted with jacks for the men to stand on, not only to expedite the
crossing, but also for the safety of the men. They are made of iron,
and put on the topgallant mast immediately over the hounds; the jack
is made round to fit the mast, and is put on before the funnel, if
used. The horns on each side are of a proportioned length to the
mast; an eye is turned in the end of each horn, for the royal rigging
to reeve through, and set up as before. When no royal rigging, the
breast backstay should be rove through the eye, and set up in the top
with a gun tackle purchase, fitted between the two after dead-eyes.

Royal rigging is quite unnecessary, in my opinion, except in large
vessels--the breast and standing backstay is sufficient.

_Royal sheets_ are either toggled or bent to the clews, rove through
sheaves, in the yard-arms, and through the after-sheave in quarter
block, on the topgallant yard; through leading thimbles on the
topmast rigging, and into the top, or on deck.

[13] This piece of wood is called a fair-leading chock.

=169.=--ROYAL AND TOPGALLANT GEAR.

When the topgallant and royal yards are sent on deck, the topgallant
sheets are stopped to the topmast-head, and hauled taut on deck. I have
seen them in harbor stopt to the tye-blocks close down to the yard.
The former is decidedly the best plan, as they are always ready for
bending; the clewlines and bowlines, are also stopped at the mast-head.

The lifts and braces are taken outside the topgallant rigging, and the
eyes stopt to the rigging at the topmast-head, before all;--hauled taut
on deck, and in the top.

Royal gear is stopt at the topgallant mast-head, and hauled taut on
deck, or in the top.

=170.=--SPANKER-BOOM, TRYSAIL-MAST, AND GAFF.

The spanker-boom, trysail-mast, and gaff, may be got on board by the
yard and stay-tackle. Put the hoops on the trysail-mast, and stop them;
sway away by a pendant tackle, and point the mast through the after
chock of the trestle-trees; lash its head to the mizen mast-head;
leather the boom in the wake of the crutch; seize on sheet-blocks,
and reeve the sheets; tar the boom, put over the foot-ropes, which
are set up, just outside the taffrail; boom-guys, which go with a
gun-tackle purchase to the quarters. Hook the topping lift to an iron
span around the boom; ship and key the boom; seize on a cleat to belay
the outhaulers to; then leather the jaws of the gaff, fit throat, and
peak-halliard blocks, brail blocks,[14] vangs and blocks,--reeve throat
and peak-halliards, hoist up the gaff, and haul taut the vangs.

The spencer gaff may be rigged nearly in the same manner.

Chocks should be fitted to go in between the lower and trysail
mast-heads. Copper the mast, in the way of the jaws.

[14] Cheek-blocks are allowed, fitted to all gaffs, by new
regulation. (_See Block Table._)

=171.=--SPANKER-BOOM SHEET AND GUYS IN ONE.

Into a bolt, with a thimble in each quarter, strap a double block with
a single strap; then seize into two grommet-straps, worked round the
boom, (wormed and covered,) two single blocks, one on each side, just
outside the taffrail, or crutch. Secure these blocks in their straps,
with a round seizing passed between the block and the boom. The rope
for the guys is middled and cut; then an eye, or cut splice made to fit
the boom end. Take the larboard guy, and reeve it through one of the
sheaves in the double block on the quarter, through the single block on
the boom, through the other sheave in the double block, through a fair
leader in the side, and pull it up on deck. The starboard one is rove
in the same manner, through the block on the starboard quarter.

=172.=--SPANKER-BOOM TOPPING-LIFTS.

A cheek with a sheave in it, is bolted on each side of the mizen
trestle-trees, under the rigging; instead of this cheek, a single
block is often strapped into a bolt, with a thimble in it. On the boom
outside the taffrail, is an iron hoop, with an eye-bolt on each side,
and thimbles in them. Parcel the thimbles in the outside bolts, and
into them splice the topping lifts; the other end reeve down through
the cheeks on the trestle-trees, or block, and splice a parceled
thimble in the end, for the purpose of hooking the jigger-tackle.

=173.=--A BRIG OR SCHOONER’S MAIN-BOOM.

There being so little boom projecting over the stern, guys are
unnecessary. On each quarter, strap a double block, and one on
each side of the boom, in separate straps: through these reeve the
sheet,--the standing-part from the strap of the quarter-block, and
hauling part through one of the sheaves of the quarter-block. In
working with the watch they are found very useful; one man can ease
over, while two more can take in the slack. A boom-tackle is fitted
with a pendant, to hook forward to an eye-bolt outside, and used when
necessary. (_Also crotch-ropes_).

=174.=--REEVING PEAK-HALLIARDS.

The standing-part is spliced into an eye-bolt underneath, or bottom
of the block; then the other end rove through the inside block on the
gaff, from forward, aft; then through a sheave in the double block,
through the outer block on the gaff, from forward, aft, and down
through the sheave in the double block, and through a leading sheave in
the bitts, or block on deck.

_You may dispense with one block, and splice the standing-part round
the gaff._

=175.=--REEVING THROAT-HALLIARDS.

The standing-part is spliced into the single block, which is hooked to
the gaff, up through the double block under the top, down through the
single block, up again through the other sheave in double block, and
through a leader, opposite to the peak-halliards.

=176.=--TO FIT SINGLE VANGS.

Middle the required length of rope, and seize a cuckold’s-neck in
the bight to fit the gaff-end, and lead one end on each side. The
cuckold’s-neck should be neatly covered with canvass, and two snug
seizings put on each quarter of the neck, showing two parts of the rope
on the top of the gaff, and one underneath. Paint the eye the same
color as the gaff.

=177.=--DOUBLE VANGS.

Seize into each bight of a long grommet strap, a single block, and
secure the strap round the end of the gaff, outside the rigging cleats,
with a lashing passed round the strap underneath the gaff, and over
each block. Splice the standing part of the fall into a bolt; reeve the
other end through the block on the gaff, and through a single block
strapped into a bolt, also in the bulwarks. Blocks fitted in this
way are called span-blocks. This is decidedly the best plan, as the
purchase can be of use until hauled close down on deck. Pendants are
now seldom used.

=178.=--FITTING GAFFS WITH CHEEKS, OR BRAIL-BLOCKS.

Close to the jaws, outside the single blocks for the throat-brails,
secure two double blocks, strapped in the same manner as the outer
blocks used for the peak-brails. The peak-brails, after being rove
through the outer blocks, are led through the double ones in the jaws,
and on deck through leading blocks.

Gaffs are also fitted with cheeks, instead of blocks; and sheaves cut
in the jaws for the throat-brails, and fair leaders; which is the
approved plan at present, and is very neat. Some ships in the service
have their gaffs fitted to hook to an iron band, with a hook in the end
of the gaff, instead of jaws. Others travel up and down an iron groove
or railway, fitted to the lower mast (using no trysail-mast). Others
again use a wooden batten nailed to the mast; some an iron jackstay,
and some a rope one. _The try-sail masts are preferable, in a gale of
wind._

=179.=--GETTING UP A GAFF.

Pass the jaw rope; man the throat and peak-halliards, the former
best, and sway the gaff up; when high enough, rack the halliards with
spun-yarn to their own parts aloft, and the halliards can be hauled up,
and coiled in the top out of the way. Steady the gaff amidships, by the
vangs.

_Note._--All gaffs should be peaked, or elevated to an angle parallel
with the mizen-topmast stay.

=180.=--LOWER STUDDING-SAIL OR SWINGING-BOOMS.

The lower swinging-booms have goose-necks fitted on one end, which in
line-of-battle ships and frigates, hook to the foremost part of the
fore chains, to iron straps fitted for the purpose. They are got in
their places when brought alongside, with a burton from the foremost
shroud, and another on the after backstay. One-third from the outer
end, an iron band is fitted, to which the rigging is hooked. When
secured for sea, they are got close into the side and lashed to a bolt
for the purpose. When in harbor, in large ships, they are sometimes
hooked to eye-bolts in the bends, which bringing them lower down, cause
the boats, when moored, to ride easier. A small Jacob’s-ladder is
fitted to the fore chains, and sets up to the boom close into the side;
also one or two seized on the boom some distance out, for the men to
get into their boats with.

The fore guy is hooked to the boom, the other end taken forward and
rove through a single block strapped in a bolt in the bowsprit cap, and
led in on the forecastle. It is sometimes rove through a block on the
spritsail-yard, and is of great use in getting the boom from the side;
if no spritsail-yard, blocks can be fitted round the outriggers, or
whiskers.

The after guy is hooked to the boom, and the other end led in through
a sheave in the side; in large ships, on the main deck, close before
the gangway port; in flush-deck vessels through the bulwarks. In large
vessels they are rove double.

The topping lift is hooked to the boom the same as the guys.

_The topping lift block._--Take a single block, large enough for the
rope to be rove in; seize it into a single strap, wormed and served,
leaving a small eye beyond the seizing, to take several parts of
small rope. Seize this block on to the second shroud (if only one
swifter forward), half-way between the futtock-stave, and seizing
of the eye, passing sufficient turns to secure it well. When seized
in this way there will be more space between the shrouds, than if
seized closer up, which will allow the topping lift to work clearer,
and cause no chafing. I have seen this block seized to the eye of a
shroud well up, but prefer the former.

_The lizard._--On the topping lift put a large-sized thimble; round
this thimble splice a piece of rope about five fathoms long; for a
large ship a piece of three-inch rope would be large enough. Reeve
the topping lift between the first and second futtock shrouds,
through the block, and send the end between the shrouds on deck.

A luff-tackle purchase is often fitted to the topping lift, half-way
up the fore rigging.

Hoist up ship and key the boom; put on single blocks for forward and
after guys, reeve, hook, and haul taut the topping lift.

_Note._--Several ships in the service have span blocks fitted across
their fore cap, and a clump block, or bull’s-eye, fitted on each fore
yard-arm, abaft the lift block. The topping lift is rove through the
block on the cap, then through the one on the yard-arm, to the boom;
which does away with the lizard, and when the boom is alongside, at
sea, the topping lift can be unhooked from the boom, and triced up
with the rest of the studding sail gear, under the fore yard. _This
method is much approved of in large ships._

=181.=--LOWER STUDDING SAIL OUTHAUL, BLOCK, &c., &c., &c.

Seize a single block into a double strap, leaving an eye to fit the
boom end, wormed and served. Then take a piece of six-thread stuff, and
pass several turns round the strap and the bolt, and hitch it round all
parts.

_Topmast studding-sail tack-block._--Take a single block the required
size, strap it with a good piece of rope, leaving a tail long enough
to clove-hitch round the boom, and seize to the bolt in the end. This
block is often strapped round the boom, and kept in its place with a
bolt in the end of the boom, or a hole bored for the purpose. Sheaves
are sometimes cut, but they are bad, as the least slue in the boom
takes away whatever purchase the sheave would give.

_Lower studding-sail halliard block, &c., &c._--Seize a single block
into a single strap, leaving an eye to fit the boom taut. A small
cleat should be nailed on the boom, to prevent the block slipping
in, or the strap secured with a bolt. When the halliards are rove, a
single block is hooked to the burton pendant, or lashed. The pendant
is sometimes fitted with a block spliced in one end, and secured to
the mast-head, over the rigging, with a lashing passed through an
eye spliced in the other, and round the mast-head. This is quite
unnecessary, as the block lashed or hooked to the pendant, answers
the same purpose.

_Reeving the halliards._--Reeve through the block to the pendant,
before the rigging, then through the block on the boom Send the
hauling part through lubber’s hole on deck, and through a leading
block.

The boom brace is spliced round the boom between the blocks. A single
block is spliced in the end, half-way between the boom; when the yard
is square, reeve a fall. The standing part, when the sail is set,
is clove-hitched round the foremost shroud of the main rigging; the
other end through a leading tail block to the same place. Small ships
are not allowed boom braces.

For inner halliards, use the fore clew-jigger, hooked to the forward
part of the top. When the sail is not set, and the boom rigged in,
the inner halliards are also used to trice the gear up; it is then
stopped with yarns snugly to the jackstay, and the ends of the gear
coiled inside the futtock-shrouds, being previously stopped together.

=182.=--TOPMAST STUDDING-SAIL SPAN BLOCKS, HALLIARDS, &c.

Seize two single blocks into each bight of a strap, long enough to go
across the topmast cap; allowing the blocks to hang clear on each side.
Take a piece of small rope, and pass a lashing round the strap, over
both blocks, under the cap, and then seize the blocks to eye-bolts in
the cap.

To make the strap, take a piece of rope of sufficient size and length;
worm and serve it, splice both ends together, and secure the blocks
in their places with round seizings. Through these blocks reeve the
halliards; first through the span blocks down, take the upper end and
reeve it down on the foreside of the topsail yard, through the block
on the neck of the boom-iron; the other end is sent down abaft the
foremost crosstrees, before the topmast rigging, through lubber’s hole
on deck, and through a leading block. When not in use at sea, the
bending end is hitched round the clew of the topsail, and the hauling
part hauled up in the top. In harbor they are generally unrove, and the
span-blocks taken down.

The downhaul is bent to the sail and made up in it.

Sheets are also bent to the sail and made up.

[Illustration]

=183.=--TOPGALLANT STUDDING-SAIL BOOMS, &c.

_Tricing lines_--Are single. A single block is seized on to a shroud,
close up, and a fall rove through it; one end is bent to the boom, the
other sent into the top. When in harbor, a thimble should be fitted
a few feet above the topsail yard, on the foremost shroud, and the
tricing line rove through it. As everything is generally done in a
hurry, trying who will be first, the booms are hardly ever properly
secured, if lowered, after loosing to dry, and the men running out on
the yards with the booms swinging about, frequently occasion accidents.

_Topmast studding-sail boom._--When no boom brace is allowed and
no lower studding-sail set, carrying the topmast studding-sail,
blowing fresh, a brace can be put on, without rigging the boom in,
as follows:--Take a belaying-pin, or anything that will answer for a
toggle, and secure it to the lower studding-sail halliards, with a
clove-hitch round the toggle, hauling the parts well taut; haul the
toggle close to the block on the boom, and belay; and it will answer
equally as well as a brace. The inner end of the halliards should not
be let go, for in case the lower studding-sail requires to be set,
the end can be hauled in, the toggle taken out, and the halliards
overhauled for bending.

_Note._--Should the boom _top up_ much, and require a martingale more
than a brace, toggle the halliards the same way, and bouse it well
taut through a leading-block, perpendicular to the boom.

=184.=--GETTING STUDDING-SAIL BOOMS UP.

All studding-sail booms have two holes in the inner end, for a
heel-lashing, and strap for the in-and-out-jigger, and sometimes a
sheave in the other end for the tack. Take a piece of rope long enough
for the heel-lashing; make a knot (a wall and crowned), in one end;
reeve it through the hole in the boom end, haul through to the knot,
and whip the other end; with the latter take two half-hitches, a little
inside the sheaves, or outer end, and seize the end to the boom. Take
a tail-block and half-hitch it half-way out the fore or main topsail
yard, according to the boom required to be got up. Through this block,
reeve a rope as a whip, (if a heavy boom, it should be a double one,)
bend one end to the span, made with the heel-lashing, so as to balance
the boom; the other reeve through a leading block on deck. Stop the
hoisting part to the boom end by the sheave, and sway away. When high
enough, cut the stops at the boom-end, and the boom will hang in the
whip, on a line with the yard; point it through the boom-iron,--cast
off the whip and span, and secure the heel-lashing, rigging boom out to
square mark.

=185.=--TOPGALLANT STUDDING-SAIL GEAR.

If blocks in the topgallant rigging, the halliards are rove through
them; one end is led into the top, abaft all, the other through the
jewel-block on the yard-arm. Jewel blocks are single blocks, seized
into single straps, having an eye to go over the bolt in the topgallant
yard-arm. A small toggle is secured to the strap with a knittle
lanyard. The eye in the strap is put over the bolt, and the toggle
put in--the upper end of the halliards are rove through this block,
on the foreside of the topgallant yard. When the sail is not bent,
the studding-sail halliards are overhauled down, and hitched to the
foremost shroud ready for bending. The jewel-blocks are always taken
off, when getting ready to send the yards down, and an overhaul knot
made on the end of the halliards, to prevent them from unreeving from
the blocks. Whenever the order is given to “unbend the topgallant
gear,” the jewel-blocks must be taken off.

_Tacks._--Sheaves are sometimes cut in the boom ends, but as they
hardly ever answer well, and generally cause delay, and likewise
require more men to get the tack out, blocks are decidedly
preferable. Tail-blocks are best, as they can be so easily taken off
and put on. Clove-hitching round the boom, and the end secured to the
eye-bolt, is preferable to having a hole bored in the boom for the
tail to reeve through, as it only weakens it, and is not necessary.
The tack is rove through this block, and when the sail is to be set,
the inner end is bent to the clew of the sail; the outer end led to
the after part of the top, where it is hauled out, and generally
belayed to a shroud or cleat.

_Note._--Belaying either the halliards or tack to the rigging is bad,
as they are constantly coming up. Cleats should be nailed on the
after part of the top for the tacks. Two small tail-blocks, one on
each side, secured to the after futtock-plate, for leading blocks,
are of great use in getting the tacks out.

A Representation of the Internal Arrangements and Stowage of the Hold
of a First-Class Sloop-of-War, U. S. N.]

=186.=--STOWING-HOLD AND SPIRIT-ROOM. (BALLAST AND TANKS).

See that the limbers are clear from chips or dirt, and place the
limber boards. Clean, sweep, and white-wash the hold; place hoop-poles
athwart-ships for dunnage, as near to each other as possible, so that
each pig of iron will rest at least on two of them. The rust should be
well beaten off the ballast, and each pig white-washed. As the stowing
of a ship’s hold and ballast, depends so much on her build, it is not
possible to lay down any precise rule; it is, however, recommended to
preserve a strict line of _level_ in the position of the tanks. To
effect this, and to produce the desired uniformity of surface, the
stower must commence the stowage from the midship stanchions in the
hold, and work _outwards_ regularly towards the direction of the wings.
The slightest irregularity of surface in the tops of the tanks may be
the means of throwing out the general stowage, and ultimately causing
a considerable deficit in the quantity of water which the hold is
calculated to contain.

A short, though rather a rough way of calculating the weight of ballast
required, is to allow one ton of ballast, for ten of tonnage for each
class of vessels.[15]

Winging the ballast tends to make a vessel roll, and building up
a-midships to keep her steady. Without venturing on details, it may be
remarked that the plan of keeping the ballast in the body of the ship,
and clear of the extremities, seems to be most generally approved of;
while at the same time care should be taken to keep her on, or parallel
to _the line of flotation_, designated by the builder. The ballast in
the spirit-room, should be a continuation of that in the hold. Make a
draft of the ballast, indicating the exact number of pigs, the position
they occupy, and their exact weight.

Previous to getting on board the water tanks, a plan of stowing them
may be easily arranged by means of rough models of them in wood,
which a carpenter can easily make. In getting the tanks from the
store, attention should be directed to the lid-sockets, which if not
properly lined with fearnought, will allow much of their contents to
escape in rolling; as also to the obtaining the proper quantity of
keys, and see that they are short enough to work between the deck and
tanks, if the vessel is a small one. White-washing tanks inside, is
found by experience to be highly useful in keeping the water pure. The
screws for letting off the water require very careful treatment; for
they are apt, if once started, never to be so tight again; and after
being three or four years in use, the nuts decay, rendering the keys
useless. If the water cannot be turned off from the tanks by the proper
mode, there seems to be no other way of getting rid of it, in a case of
necessity, but by forcing a hole in the bottom with a crowbar.

The tanks should be stowed during the time the ship is rigging.

_Note._--By a late order, the valve in the bottom of all water tanks
is stopped up, and the screw taken out. Those that are now made new,
have no screw. There is also an alteration in the lids for the better.

[15] The weight of chain cables and water tanks, are considered in
this calculation, also half of the shot. Also a consultation with the
builder.

=187.=--STOWING CASKS.

Strike down their beds, place and whitewash them; then commence stowing
the casks at the after bulk-head in the hold, observing to have the
largest casks in the kelson tier, and the gauges of the cask on each
side of the kelson, to correspond. Be careful that the bung-holes are
all up, the bilge free, and head clear.

After completing the first tier, go on with the second, placing hanging
beds between the casks, and stowing barked wood in all the breakages.
As the tiers approach the wings, let the size of the cask diminish.

=188.=--STOWAGE OF PROVISIONS, NAVAL STORES, &c.

Stow the beef on the larboard side, and the pork, starboard side; with
the flour, rice, and beans in the wings; chocking all fore and aft with
wood. The casks in the spirit-room are stowed in the same manner, with
the exception that the stowage is commenced forward, instead of aft.
Whiskey, molasses, and vinegar are always stowed in casks. The liquors
of the medical department, and purser’s stores, are generally stowed in
the spirit-room. Dry provisions should not be stowed under the wet, and
should be placed in such a manner, that when required, they may be got
at without disturbing all the hold.

Make a draft of the lower, and riding tiers, and spirit-room, with the
guages of all the casks on the draft; the number of barrels, boxes,
&c., with the kind of provisions they contain.

The shot and wads may also be got on board, and stowed in their
respective lockers.

=189.=--STOWING CHAIN CABLES.

The chain cables are got on board through the hawse-holes,[16] and
paid down the main hatchway, into their respective lockers. They are
from _ninety to one hundred and eighty_ fathoms in length, and are
slip-shackled, or lashed to the kelson.

_Note._--See table of allowance of chain cable for class, &c.

[16] If the vessel is alongside of the wharf, the chain-cables may be
got in by a _shoot_, through the _port_, or over the _rail_.

=190.=--TO GET ON BOARD AND STOW THE HEMP CABLES.

Hemp-cables are one hundred and twenty fathoms in length, two are now
allowed to all vessels, from a ship of the line, to a third class
sloop of war, inclusive. The cables are taken from the rope-walk, and
coiled upon a car having a large hole in its bottom, and after being
transported to the vessel, or lighter at the wharf, the upper end of
the coil is passed down through all the flakes, and through the hole
in the bottom of the car, then coiled away again in the lighter. By
dipping the end in this manner, grinds or kinks are prevented, and the
cable is got into the lighter, with only one turn in it.

The lighter being towed off to the ship, haul under the bows; place
mats in the sides and sills of one of the forward ports; get the cables
in on deck, and French-flake them fore and aft. They are now with the
same number of turns in them, as when they left the rope-walk. See that
the tiers are clear, and that the gratings are properly placed for the
cable to lay on. Pass the end of the spare one below, and coil away
with the sun, on the starboard side of the tier; make the coil as large
as possible, taking care not to have too many flakes in a sheave, as
the inside strands of the inner ones would be injured, by breaking in.

Pass the ends of the starboard one on the larboard side, and the
larboard on the starboard side. Clinch them around the main-mast, or to
the beams, coil them away with the sun, letting the ends remain out, to
be pointed or tailed if necessary. Join the pointed ends with a short
splice, worming the tails along the cable. The upper ends are crowned
in the following manner, viz.: clap a seizing round the cable about two
fathoms from the end, and unlay it to the seizing. With the three inner
strands form an artificial eye; cut off the three next ones and woold
their ends; with the three outer ones, form a crown, worm the ends
along the cable, and clap on seizings in proportion.

The stream cable and messenger are coiled away in the tier of the spare
cable. The hawsers, if possible, should be stowed in such a manner,
that the end of every _one_ could be passed up together if required.

=191.=--CATHEAD STOPPERS.

When not fitted with the slip, or patent stoppers, a good piece of
rope, in proportion to the size of the anchor, has a stopper-knot in
one end, then rove through the cathead, and hauled taut. It should be
well wormed, parceled, and served in the way of the cat-heads, and
sufficiently far towards the end, to take the ring of the anchor.
The end should have a becket put in, and pointed over. Take a piece
of small rope, and splice it into the inside yarns of the stopper,
the same as a tail, or knot the yarns together; then marl down, and
point over. The becket should be made large enough to take a good
hauling-line, for the purpose of hauling the end of the stopper
in-board, after being rove through the ring of the anchor.

=192.=--SHANK PAINTER.

A piece of chain is secured to the side; a large thimble, well
parceled, is put into the last link; round this thimble splice the
piece of rope intended to make the tail of the shank-painter; it is the
same sized rope as the cathead stopper. The other end is pointed, with
a becket in.

_Note._--The patent iron slip or trick-stopper, is now generally used
in the service, by those who can procure them. They are not allowed
by the regulation, but quite a number of ships have them fitted.

=193.=--FISH-DAVIT GEAR.

The davit is stept into a shoe in the fore-chains, for the purpose.
A double block is seized into a double strap, leaving an eye to fit
the davit-head; both parts of the strap are marled together. Another
double block is seized into a double strap, having a large hook[17]
and thimble, to take the arm of the anchor. Take a large single block,
seize it into a single strap, leaving an eye to fit the davit-head; it
will lay the opposite way to the double one, and allow the hauling part
of the fall to lead fore and aft along the gangway; or up aloft through
a leader to the fore pendants.

_Back rope._--To the back of the hook, clove-hitch and seize the
end down, of a piece of rope, long enough to lead to the fore
chains, or into the head, when the fish-fall is overhauled. This is
taken forward when hooking the fish. Cat-back is used for the same
purpose--_i. e._, _hooking the cat_.

_Guys, bolts, rigging, &c._--In the fore and after side of the davit,
bolts are driven. The fore-guy is a piece of stout rope, long enough
to reach from the davit, when stepped, to the after side of the
cat-head, leaving room for lashing. The after-guy is another piece
of rope, long enough to reach the after part of the fore-chains, and
both fitted as follows:--splice a hook and thimble in one end, into
the other splice an eye, and into this eye splice a lashing.

Get a jigger on the foremost swifter, and hoist the davit into the
step or shoe. Hook the guys to the bolts in the davit-head, and set
them up to the cat-head, and after part of the fore-chains. Put over
the double block, then the single, and reeve the fish-fall. Take
two tackles, clap a good strap round the foremast, hook the double
block to this strap, and the others to selvagee-straps round the
davit-head. The strap round the foremast should be in a direct line
with the davit-head when perpendicular. These tackles will answer for
topping-lifts, and will be found much better than the old-fashioned
topping-lifts for stowing anchors.

_Note._--I would recommend the iron davit, in preference to the
wooden one, on account of its being more durable, much neater, more
convenient for stowage and also requires less gear.

[17] Properly called a fish-hook.

[Illustration]

=194.=--GETTING ON BOARD, AND STOWING ANCHORS.

[Illustration]

The fish-davits being rigged, reeve and overhaul the cat and
fish-falls, get the anchors into a lighter, and tow them under the
bows; pass up the stream-cable, and clench it to the ring of the
bower-anchor; hook the cat, and run the anchor up to the cat-head. Pass
the stopper, hook the fish, and pass the shank-painter. Unbend the
stream-cable, and bend it to the waist-anchor, then drop the lighter
aft, and secure her under the berth of the anchor. Brace the fore yard
in, and the main yard up as much as possible; top them up a little,
hook a stout tackle to act as a rolling-tackle, and bouse the lifts
and trusses well taut. Pass a lashing round the slings of the yard, to
ease the trusses. Hook both top-burtons to the yard-arm, and set well
up the opposite breast-backstays. Pass a strap round the topmast, just
above the lower cap. Hook the double block of a stout pendant-tackle to
this strap, and the single one is hooked just without the place where
the bull’s-eye for the pendant is to be lashed; haul well taut the
lifts, burtons, and pendant-tackles alike--reeve whips, and get up the
triatic-stays. The bull’s-eyes for the pendants are lashed sufficiently
far out on the yards, to allow the anchor to clear the ship’s side.
Reeve the pendant up through it, and clench the end to the lower
mast-head; have a thimble in the lower end, to which the purchases are
hooked. Have a thwartship-tackle in readiness, to bouse the anchor to
the gunwale; lash the lower block of the main-purchases, to the crown
of the anchor, having guys from each fluke to keep it steady. The fore
purchase-block is lashed to the ring.

Rack the topsail-tye aloft, and hook the lower block of the
fore-topsail halliards to a stout strap, passed round the shank of
the anchor amidships, then lashed above the middle of the upper arm
of the stock. “Sway away;” when high enough, haul over on the stay
and thwart-ship tackles, and get the bill of the anchor upon the
gunwale. A cleat is nailed on the lower part of the stock, a lashing
passed under it, and round the timber-head in the after part of the
forecastle-bulwark for the purpose; another lashing from the same place
to the upper arm of the stock, and frap all together. A shore is fitted
from the side, on which the anchor rests, and a lashing passed round
the shank through a span-shackle bolt in the side for the purpose; the
inside fluke rests on a bill-board on the fore end of the chess-tree,
or after part of the fore chains. Some ships stow their anchors further
forward than others. The anchor being secured, unbend the stream cable,
and unlash purchases.

Drop the lighter round on the other side of the ship--shift over
the purchases, secure the yards, and get up the other bower and
waist-anchors in the same manner. When done, pass the stream-cable
below, and coil it down in the tier.

_Note._--Belaying cat-head stopper. After being boused well taut
with a jigger, take as many turns as the rope will allow, over the
timber-head on the forecastle bulwarks, and seize it well to its own
part with spun-yarn. The shank-painter is set taut and belayed in the
same manner.

=195.=--BENDING THE CABLES.

A rope is rove through the ring of the anchor, the end led in through
the hawse-hole, and bent to the cable with a timber-hitch, three or
four fathoms from the end, and stopt along to the end of the cable.
Haul out on the ring-rope, and when there is sufficient of the end
through the ring, cut the stops, unbend the ring-rope, and form an
inside clinch, having it smaller than the ring of the anchor. The bends
are put on opposite to each other, and a small bend put on near the end
to secure it. Render the cables as far as possible through the clinch,
and stop them together to prevent chafes, &c.

_Note._--The chain cables are shackled to the rings of the anchors;
then bend the buoys and buoy-ropes.

=196.=--TO RANGE AND STOPPER THE CABLES.

Before ranging the cables, they should be bitted, which is done as
follows:--When the cables are bent, haul up sufficient slack to form
a bight abaft the bitts; throw the bight which is thus formed, over
the head of the bitts (and in case it is to be weather bitted, take
another _turn_ round the cavil). In ranging, get a tail-block over
the hatchway, through which reeve a rope; overhaul down, and hitch
to the cable. Take the running part close out to the side, bouse on
the rope, and flake the cable fore and aft the deck. Clap on deck and
bitt-stoppers, before and abaft the bitts; put on rounding at the
range, if hemp, which is intended to veer, and also have cable mats
in readiness, to be used as may be required. If a hemp-cable, a small
range forward of the part bitted; if chain-cable it merely requires
bitting; ranging is unnecessary.

_Note._--When the anchor is let go, veer from the locker through the
compressor--(_i. e._, supposing it to be a chain.)

=197.=--STOPPERS, &c., &c.

_The trip-stoppers._--Both ends are made fast to eye-bolts under
the after part of the fore-channels. The score in the end of the
waist-anchor stock rests in the bight, and is used to trip the anchor
clear of the ship’s side, when let go.

Deck-stoppers are hooked to bolts in the deck. They have a knot worked
in the end, with a lanyard fast to it. The lanyard is passed round both
the stopper and cable, abaft the knot, and then wormed along the cable,
forward of it. (_See claw-stopper_).

Ring-stoppers are ropes middled; the bights are passed through the
deck-bolts, the ends rove through the bight, and dogged along the cable.

Bitt-stoppers are tailed and rove through the sampson-knee forward of
the bitts, then taken over the cable abaft the bitts, under again, and
wormed along the cable forward. A tackle may be hooked to this, and
used for veering.

Dog-stoppers are very long, and are used in the tiers. One end is
clenched round the main-mast, and the other wormed along the cable.

The wing-stoppers are similar, but are clenched around the orlop-deck
beams in the wings.

=198.=--COMPRESSORS, OR COMBING-STOPPERS.

For hemp-cables they are very long, and are tailed. Two holes are bored
through the deck, abaft the after beam of the hatch; one end of the
stopper is rove downwards through one of the holes, passed under the
cable, and rove up again, through the other hole. Both ends are then
dogged round the cable taut, so as to nip it against the beam.

The compressor for chain-cables is an iron elbow, one end of which is
bolted to the forward beam of the hatch underneath, and intended to
work on the bolt. The elbow goes round the cable, having an eye in the
other end, to which a luff-tackle is hooked; which being hauled on,
stoppers the cable effectually.

=199.=--PUTTING ON NIPPERS.

Nippers should be from three to five fathoms in length, and made of
the best rope-yarns. They are used when heaving up the anchor, and are
passed as follows:--Lay the messenger on the cable, and begin two or
three fathoms abaft the hawse-hole; two round turns are first taken
with the end of the nipper, round the messenger, and held by a boy,
then round both. The other end is wormed round the cable, as the first
was round the messenger. When the strain becomes heavy, racking, and
even round turns may be used, having also small heavers, and selvagees
to secure the ends; taking care to have dry ones to use when the anchor
is up and down.

_Note._--Some ships have done away with the nippers altogether, and
use nothing but the selvagee and heaver. Each nipper-man provides two
selvagees, and one heaver; also an iron pin of proper size to put
through the links of the chain-cable, to prevent the muddy chain from
slipping through the strap.

=200.=--IRON CLAW-STOPPERS, AND CLEAR-HAWSE SHACKLES.

[Illustration]

These are used for chain-cables, instead of rope-stoppers, and are
found very convenient, and more durable than rope. They are allowed
to every ship in the service by the new regulation, and are fitted
as follows:--A piece of chain four feet long, is fitted with a
devil’s-claw in one end, and a slip-hook in the other; a slip-ring also
in the long link in the chain, for the end of the slip-hook.

=201.=--TO CUT, AND PASS A MESSENGER.

The length should be equal to twice the distance from the after part
of the capstan, to the roller in the manger, and add four times the
circumference of the capstan-band; this is sufficient for splicing in
the eyes and taking turns. The messenger is passed with three round
turns, and then the eyes lashed with the lanyard, figure-of-eight
fashion. The part which is brought to the cable is undermost.

_Note._--Some messengers are fitted with a strap and toggle instead
of a lashing; this plan is much quicker than the old way. The size
of the strap, ought to be one half the size of the messenger; in
length it should be once the circumference of the capstan on the
bight. Instead of splicing the two ends of the strap together, make
a spritsail-sheet knot with the six strands, reeve one bight of the
strap through one eye of the messenger, the other bight through the
other eye, and toggle them together.

_To dip a messenger._--Cast off the lashing, slack up the turns, and
pass the eye up or down, as necessary, between the turns and capstan.
Render the turns through each other, and pass the lashing again.

=202.=--SPLICING ROPE-CABLES.

Cut off the ropemaker’s fag-end, and unlay the cable sufficiently far
for splicing. Take the inside yarns and lay them up into three strands,
equal to the piece of rope intended for the tails, and splice these
small strands and tails together. Take the outside yarns and make
them into three-yarn plaits or knittles, then marl the remaining yarn
down over the splice and tail, and point over all with the plaits or
knittles. The cable is then opened with setting fids and commanders,
and the splice made, each strand boused through with jiggers; the ends
are put in twice on the tier, and once on the anchor part. Take a good
piece of small-rope, and pass it as a round-seizing, close to the
splice, and cross it on all sides. When finished it will look square;
and pass another, with smaller stuff, close to the ends. Worm the ends
into the lay of the cable, and pass three or four spun-yarn seizings,
at equal distances round them and the cable, to keep them in the
lay--make the seizings, and whip the ends of the tails. The size of the
seizing, and number of turns, depend on the size of the cable.

Packingham’s Rudder, &c., &c.]

_Bends._--The small rope used as seizings in clinching, are so
called. The end of the cable for clinching to the anchor should be
wormed with good strands, and backed with good spun-yarn, and the end
capped. The worming should be long enough to form the clinch, and
the cable well tarred before and after its being done. The lay of
the cable opens in clinching, and being wormed, it prevents the wet
getting into the heart of the rope, or lodging. To pass the bends,
have a good piece of rope of the length and size required; bring both
parts together, leaving one end a third longer than the other; then
pass it round both parts of the cable, and put both ends through
the bight. Pass the under turns with the short end, the upper or
riding-turns with the long one. Stop both ends well with spun-yarn
to their next parts, and cross the whole seizing or bend, with
sennit; pass the sennit on the bight, and secure both together with a
reef-knot.

=203.=--TO SHIP, AND UNSHIP A RUDDER.

Have the rudder brought under the stern, hung to a scow. Bore a hole
through the beam or carling over the rudder case--drive an eyebolt
up through it, and fit a washer and forelock. Strap a large single
block[18] with hook and thimble, and hook it to the eye-bolt; reeve a
top-pendant through the single block, down through the rudder-case,
and hitch it to an eye-bolt, which is temporarily fitted into the
rudder-head. Clap a deck-tackle on to the other end of the pendant;
have heel-ropes leading forward on each side, after being rove through
their respective holes in the rudder. Man the deck-tackle fall, and
hoist away. When the rudder is high enough, guy it fair with the
heel-ropes; see the pintles fair for entering the gudgeons,--lower
away, and fit in the wood-lock. Come up the pendant, unreeve the
heel-ropes--take the bolt from the rudder-head, also the one from the
beam or carling above--ship the tiller, and reeve the wheel-ropes.

_To unship it._--Fit the bolts, single block, pendant and deck-tackle
as before, unreeve the wheel-ropes, unship the tiller, knock out
the wood-lock, and “sway away.” When the pintles are clear of the
gudgeons, lower away, and secure it to the scow or lighter--tow it on
shore, and parbuckle, or hoist it out of the water or scow.

[18] If a top-block can be procured, it will answer best, as the neck
of the hook being shorter, it will give more hoist.

=204.=--GETTING THE GUNS ON BOARD.

[Illustration]

The gun-carriages and all the equipments belonging to the guns are
brought alongside in lighters, and hoisted in with the yard & stay. Get
them on their respective decks, and reeve the purchase for getting the
guns on board.

_Securing the main-yard._--To the bolts in the lower cap, hook
the double blocks of two burtons. The single ones are hooked to
selvagee-straps, round the yard, close to the lifts, and the falls
sent on deck, through leading-blocks. Bouse well taut the main-lifts
and burtons together, and belay. Then pass a good lashing round the
main-yard in the slings, and main-mast, to keep the yard steady, and
support the trusses, they being previously boused well taut.

Take the top tackle-pendant, and reeve it through a top-block,
secured well to the yard with a good lashing, passed round the hook,
on the outside quarter; take the pointed end over the cap, pass
it between the head of the mast and heel of the topmast, take two
half-hitches on its own part, or that from the yard, and secure the
end with a round-seizing of spun-yarn. Get a single whip upon the
main-yard, close to the lashing, bend one end to the hook of the
top-tackle fall-block; hoist the block up and hook it to the thimble
in the pendant. Through this and the other top-tackle fall-block,
reeve a fall; clench one end (the standing part), round the main yard
close to the block; the other end, when rove full, through a leading
block on deck, by the bitts.

The garnet-purchase is a pendant, with a thimble in the upper
end, which is hooked to the main-pendant-tackle; the other end is
rove down through holes bored in the deck for the purpose, and a
stout hook and thimble spliced or turned into the end. The garnet
should be long enough to go on the lower-deck, and the holes bored
perpendicular to the centre of the port through which the guns are to
be got on board. The slings are made of breaching-stuff, twice the
length of the gun, the ends spliced together, and the strands put in
twice each way; seize an eye on the bight, large enough to go over
the breach of the gun; put over the eye, and put the slings along
the upper part of the gun, lashing them with a piece of rope round
all, just forward of the trunnion; put the other end over the muzzle,
and in toggle. Lash the purchase-block to the bight of the slings,
and also bend on a hawser to weigh the gun, in the event of parting
the purchase. “Sway away;” drop the lighter from under the gun, and
when the breach is as high as the port, hook the garnet and also
an a-thwartship-tackle to the breech-ring; haul on the tackle and
bring the gun in through the port--run a carriage under--lower away;
place the trunnions fair, and clamp them; come up the purchases, and
transport the gun to its port. The lower and main-deck guns are got
in in the same way. The cannonades are taken over the rail; a toggle
is put in the muzzle, one bight of the slings over the cascable, the
other over the muzzle, and back-lashed to the toggle; the stay or
purchase-block is lashed on midships of the slings, and the stay or
pendant-tackle to the same place; consequently the gun will come in
square. Have the bed and slide ready, place it fair, and drive in the
naval-bolt. Ship the screws, beds, and coins; reeve the breeching,
hook side and train-tackles; see the guns square in the ports, and
secure them.

The main-deck guns might be taken in over the rail, and struck down
the main-hatch; but I prefer their being taken in through the port,
if plenty of men.

_Note._--The reason for having additional security on the main-yard
is, because in getting in the guns, the strain is altogether on the
yard; while in getting up the anchors, the strain is divided between
two yards. The burtons are sometimes frapped in with the main-lift,
between the yard and cap; but I prefer their not being done so, as
they will all render fairer, when the strain comes on them. It is
customary to top the main-yard up; but I saw a line-of-battle ship’s
guns got in without it, and as it brings a greater strain on the
slings and trusses, it should not be done to so great an extent as is
the practice.

_Caution._--When the garnet-purchase is raising the breech to the
level required to place the gun in its carriage, care must be taken
that the main-purchase be _not_ lowered by a turn, but that the men
on the fall “walk back” with a steady step.

When the gun is lodged in its carriage, it is removed to its proper
port, and another carriage is rolled to the receiving port, ready for
the reception of the next gun, and so on.

=205.=--FITTING SHACKLE-BREECHINGS.

If it be required to fit the breechings on this recently improved
plan, it will be necessary to taper and point both ends of the rope
preparatory to splicing or turning-in a shackle on each extremity. The
shackle should be turned-in and secured to each end of the breeching by
two separate seizings, one close to the shackle, and the other towards
the pointed end of the rope. They are frequently spliced into a thimble
and then shackled, which I think is much neater.[19]

By this simple and serviceable method, the breeching may be shifted
in a few seconds, it being no longer necessary to reeve it through
the ring at the breech. An opening is now made in the cascable, which
admits the introduction of the breeching on the bight; and the cascable
fitted with a hinge or snatch, and sometimes a bolt going through the
cascable, confines the breeching, and prevents it jumping out on the
recoil of the gun.

[19] This last improvement was introduced by FRANCIS GRICE, _Esq._,
chief Naval Constructor, _U. S. N._

=206.=--TRIATIC STAYS.

A double block is strapped into a pendant, a hook and thimble spliced
into one end; a single block is strapped with a hook and thimble, a
fall is rove, the standing-part bent into a becket in the strap of the
single block; sometimes the double block is strapped, and the pendant
spliced in over the seizing. A good strap with a thimble seized into
it, is fitted to the strap of the lower block. A piece of rope is
spliced round the strap of the fore-stay block, and the other end, when
cut to the required length, spliced round the strap of the main-stay
block, and seized. This is called the span, and is generally the
length between the fore and main-hatchways. The main-stay hooks to a
strap with a thimble in it, from round the main-mast-head on the fore
side; the fore from one abaft, fitted in the same manner. The main
one generally comes down alongside the slings, the fore one between
the trestle-trees, abaft. The pendant and tackle are sometimes fitted
separate, to hook, and are easier stowed away.

_Note._--In case of emergency, these pendants may be taken round the
mast-head, and hooked to their own parts. I have known some ships to
use them this way altogether.

=207.=--HOISTING IN SPARS.

Overhaul down the fore and main-yard tackles, fore and main-stays,
and lead their falls to the opposite side of the deck the spars come
in at. Hook burtons to the lower caps (double blocks), single ones to
selvagees round the lower yard-arm, close inside the lifts. Send the
falls on deck, and pull up the lifts and burtons together, and trusses;
brace the fore-yard in, and hook on to the spars. They should be always
hoisted in as stowed.[20]

If the spars are too long to come in abreast, between the fore and
main-masts, such as topmasts, hook the main-stay to the strap round the
foremost end, and fore-stay to the after one; then hook the yards to
separate straps made of pieces of stout rope knotted together, or good
selvagees, according to the weight of the spar. Man the yards and walk
them up; when clear of hammock-nettings, haul on the main-stay, ease
the fore and main-yards, keeping the spar square, and get the foremost
end inside the rigging; then ease the main-stay, and get the spar in
its place on the booms. Small spars can be got in with the main-yard, a
double whip on main-stay, or single guy if required.

[20] The spars intended to be stowed underneath, should be hoisted
in first; such as topmasts, half-yards, and jib-boom, for the lower
tier, and round off with the smaller spars on the top.

=208.=--STOWING BOOMS.

The spars on the starboard side are stowed as follows, viz.:
Main-topmast, head aft; main-topgallant, (mast-fishes) half-yard,
main topmast studding-sail booms, and jib-boom. On the larboard
side--fore-topmast, head forward; fore-topgallant-mast, mast-fish,
half-yard, fore topmast studding-sail booms, flying-jib-boom, &c.

There are several small spars which are equally divided, to make the
booms as snug and neat as possible. A great deal of room can be gained
by stowing them amidships in one pile, and the boats on each side.
As the spars are stowed, they should be _numbered on each end_, also
a list taken, and painted on the foreside of the boom-boards; by so
doing it will save much time and trouble to find any spar that may be
required; as I have seen all the booms unlashed before a spar was found.

The booms are lashed to span-shackles in the deck for the purpose. A
few small spars should be kept out, to drive under the lashing, to set
all taut. When stowed they are covered with tarpaulins, or matting made
for the purpose. When the spars are all in, square the yards.

_Note._--It is becoming the general practice, to stow both topmasts
with their heads forward. Many ships stow all their spars amidships
in one pile, with the exception of the fore and main-topmasts,
which are stowed outside of the boats; spare main-topsail yard on
the larboard-quarter, the fore on the starboard-quarter, in the
chains, and spare jib-boom across the stern, secured underneath the
stern-davits.[21]

[21] Some ships stow topmasts and all amidships; but this is a bad
plan, as it would be necessary to take out all, to get a topmast if
required, it being underneath.

[Illustration: Brig-of-War, under full Sail.]

PART III.

REEVING RUNNING RIGGING.

=209.=--FORE BOWLINES.

The fore bowlines have an eye in one end, to go over the toggle, and
are rove through a single block, seized into a single strap, and
secured to the fore-stay collar with a seizing passed through an eye
left in the strap, and the other end led in on the forecastle.

The fore and main clue-garnets are hitched to the yards, then rove
through a block lashed in the clews of the sail, up through a block on
the quarter of the yard, down to the fife-rail.

=210.=--FORE-TOPSAIL CLEWLINES.

Topsail clewlines are fitted the same as clew-garnets, and sometimes
with a whip; they come on deck through lubber’s hole.

When fitted with a whip, a piece of rope nearly equal to the double
clewline, is rove through the quarter-block, and an eye spliced in one
end, which is secured with a seizing round the clew, when the sail is
bent. In the other end, splice a single block, and reeve a fall through
it; one end splice into a bolt in the deck, and the other reeve through
a leading-block, well apart from the standing-part.

_Note._--The disadvantage of double clewlines, is, the points getting
in the clew-blocks when clewing up, or sheeting home.

=211.=--TOPSAIL BUNTLINES

Are toggled to the foot of the sails, and rove through single blocks
at the mast-head, underneath the rigging, and through lubber’s hole on
deck. Cheeks or sheaves set in the foremost end of the trestle-trees
are best, as they keep the buntlines clear of the belly of the sails.
Blocks in bolts will do equally as well, but do not look so neat.
I would recommend fitting a shoe-block underneath the eyes of the
rigging, on each side, in preference.

Buntline-spans are short pieces of rope, with a thimble in one end, and
the other end whipped; the buntlines are rove through these thimbles,
before being bent to the sail, or rove at the mast-head. At sea these
spans are knotted together, abaft the tye-blocks on the yard, and
stopped to them. When in harbor, they are let go, to allow the sails
being triced well-up to furl, or hauled out to dry, by the bowlines,
when toggled to the foot of the sail.

=212.=--FORETOP BOWLINES

Have an eye spliced in one end to go over the toggle on the bridle;
the other is rove through a block at the bowsprit-cap, strapped into a
bolt, or a sheave cut in the after end of the bees and led in on the
forecastle.

=213.=--MAIN BUNTLINES.

There are two on each quarter, and reeve on the bights. Reeve first
through the large sheave in a shoe-block, then reeve both ends, from
forward, through the double block under the fore part of the main-top,
and bend or clinch both ends to the holes in the foot of the sail for
the purpose. Sometimes toggles are fitted into the holes, with double
straps, and an eye spliced into each end of the buntlines. If no
shoe-block is to be got, seize two single ones into one strap. Through
the other sheave of shoe-block, reeve a fall; clinch one end to the
main-stay by the foremast, or splice an eye and seize it round it. The
other end reeve through a leading block, seized into a single strap,
leaving an eye to seize it to the stay, or through a sheave or leading
block in the fore-bitts.

=214.=--FORE BUNTLINES

Generally toggle to the foot of the sail, and are sometimes clinched;
then rove through a double block under the fore part of the fore-top,
and through fair leading sheaves in the racks to the bulwarks. The
buntline should be long enough to allow the sail to belly. The outside
leg of the buntline is sometimes rove through a thimble strapped
into the foot of the sail, and clenched into a cringle put into the
bolt-rope, a few feet above the clew.

=215.=--MAIN BOWLINE

Is a runner and tackle, and is rove and unrove as required. It is rove
through the thimble seized on the bowline bridle; the end of the runner
is secured round the fore-bitts, or to a cleat. The lower block of the
gun-tackle purchase is fitted with a hook, and hooked to a strap close
to the end of the runner, for the purpose. I have seen the main-bowline
boused up to the weather-forecastle bulwarks, which I think preferable,
not seeing any very great advantage from its being hauled amidships;
particularly when it is considered that the main-topsail yard, on a
wind, is braced abaft the main-yard.

=216.=--TOPGALLANT SHEETS

Are rove through the sheave in the topsail-yard, then through the after
sheave in the double block in the quarter of the topsail-yard, and
through a leading sheave or block on deck. The upper end is bent to the
clew of the topgallant-sail; sometimes a long-eye is spliced, which
goes over a toggle in the clew of the sail. They are also fitted with
sister-hooks, which is the latest and most improved plan.

[Illustration]

=217.=--TOPGALLANT CLEWLINES

Are bent through the clew of the sail, and secured with a sheet-bend;
it is then rove through the foremost sheave on the quarter-block on the
yard, and sent down through lubber’s hole on deck.

=218.=--FORE TOPGALLANT BOWLINES

Are toggled to the bridle of the sail. The fore one is rove through
a single block at the jib-boom end, one on each side, and led in
on the forecastle through fair leaders. These blocks are strapped
like span-blocks, and lashed together on the upper side with two
lashing-eyes; they are sometimes strapped singly, and go over the
boom-end, or seized to the guys. Double blocks are also sometimes put
in these straps, and the two inner sheaves used as jib-brail-leaders.

=219.=--MAIN TOPGALLANT BOWLINES

Are toggled to the bridle of the sail, then rove through sheaves
cut in the after part of the fore-topmast-crosstrees, and through
lubber’s hole, through fair leading sheaves on deck. Single tail-blocks
are sometimes used, clove-hitched round the after shroud in the
fore-topmast rigging, close up to the futtock-stave, or seized.

=220.=--MIZEN TOPGALLANT BOWLINES

Are toggled to the bridle of the sail, and rove through single blocks
on each side of the main-mast head, and through fair leading blocks on
deck. A double block is often used instead of two single ones on each
side, one sheave for the brace, the other for the bowline. They should
be led from lubber’s hole abaft all, between the cat-harpen legs, or
futtock-shrouds.

=221.=--TOPGALLANT BUNTLINES

Are seldom used in light weather, although very necessary in taking in
sail, when blowing fresh, as they save much time, and in some instances
a man’s life. On a wind it spills the sail, and prevents its getting
over the lee yard-arm; and going free enables the men to furl it much
easier. A strong proof of their utility may be inferred from the fact
that merchant vessels, who have as little rope rove as possible, and
are generally weak-handed, have their sails fitted with buntlines.

They are fitted as follows:--A piece of rope with a thimble on it, is
spliced into two eyelet-holes, worked in the foot of the sail, about
a third from each clew.[22] Splice the end of the buntline round the
thimble; reeve the other end through a single block, seized into a
single strap, and secured round the topgallant mast-head by a lashing
passed over all; send the end of the buntline through lubber’s hole, on
deck before all to the fife-rail.

[22] This piece of rope is called a span.

=222.=--ROYAL BOWLINES.

The fore royal-bowline is rove through a block at the flying-jib-boom
end, and led in on the forecastle, through a fair leader, the same as
the topgallant-bowline, and the main-royal bowlines through the chock
at fore-topmast head.

=223.=--REEF-TACKLES

Are sometimes double, and also fitted with a whip, as clewlines, or
pendant and burton. When double, a single block is seized into a single
strap, having a thimble in it, and the seizing passed between the block
and thimble. This block goes on the bridle, or cringle, in the leech of
the topsails. One end of the reef-tackle is clinched round the neck of
the boom-iron, the other rove through the block, up through the sheave
in the yard-arm, and through the upper sheave in the sister-block,
through lubber’s hole, and through a leading block or sheave on deck.

When single, an eye is spliced in the end of the pendant, to go over
a toggle fitted to a bridle, as above; the other end rove through the
yard and sister-block, a single block spliced into the end, and a whip
rove, as on the clewline.

_Note._--The generality of naval ships use their top-burtons with
short hide-pendants; some object to this, as the top-burtons may be
wanted, when they are in use as reef-tackles.

=224.=--LEECH-LINES.

The forward leech-lines are rove through the upper sheave-hole of a
shoe-block; both parts are then rove through a double block, hooked
with a pendant to the lower cap, then through two single blocks seized
to the jackstays on the yards, and are clinched to the leeches of the
courses, forward of the sail.

The lower legs are rove through the other sheave-hole in the
shoe-block, and the standing-part made fast to the fife-rail; the other
end being used to haul up the sails.

The after leech-lines are rove through blocks on the underneath part
of the yard, and clinched to the courses abaft the sail, to the same
places as the forward ones.

_Note._--Shoe-blocks are now pretty much out of fashion--when they
are not used, both parts of the leech-lines are led on deck and the
whip-purchase dispensed with.

=225.=--SLAB-LINES

Are bent to the middle of a span at the foot of the sail, led up abaft,
and rove through a block lashed to the grommet or span, around the
straps of the quarter-blocks of the lower yards, and down on deck.
These are very necessary in light weather, and in rough weather, may be
converted into spilling-lines.

=226.=--ROYAL CLEW-LINES

Are bent to the clews of the sail, rove through the quarter-blocks on
the yard, and led either in the tops, or on deck.

=227.=--FITTING TACKS AND SHEETS, BUMKIN-GEAR, &c.

A single block is seized into a single strap, leaving an eye to fit the
bumkin; this block is made with a shoulder, which lays on the bumkin
when the block is on.

Bumkin-braces are now generally chain; one is hooked to the bow,
and two to the cutwater; and set up with a lanyard rove through
span-shackles in their ends, and others on the bumkin, or with a
turnbuckle.

_Reeving the tack._--Clinch the large end round the bumkin, outside
the block, having been well wormed, parceled, and served, far enough
towards the small end to take the block on the bumkin, when the sail
is reefed. Reeve the small end through the block in the sail, then
through that on the bumkin, and in on the forecastle through a hole
in the bulwarks, for the purpose.

_Fore sheet._--The large end is served the same as the tack, and is
hooked into a bolt in the side for the purpose; the small end is rove
through the block in the sail, and through a sheave in the side, or
gangway bulwarks. Large ships generally work the fore-sheet in the
waist (main-deck), but it is often worked on the gangway, (spar-deck).

=228.=--YARD TACKLE TRICING-LINES.

If no cheek on the yard, take the pendants taut along from the
yard-arm, and then secure a single tail-block. On the foremost shroud,
well up, seize another single block, fitted with a single strap,
leaving room when seized-in, for the seizing with which it is secured
to the shroud. Round the fiddle-block in the pendant, between both
sheaves, secure the tricing-line with a running-eye; then reeve the
other end through the cheek, or tail-block, and then through the single
block on the shroud, and on deck.

=229.=--TO REEVE AND TOGGLE ROYAL-HALLIARDS.

Take a round-turn with the yard-rope, well up round the strap of the
block, with the long-eye; reeve the bight through the eye and put the
toggle in it; then bring the end up from the block seized to the eye
of the shroud, and reeve it through the one on the yard-rope, send the
end on deck, and reeve it through a leading block.

When half-hitched, the lower block is fitted as described, and secured;
the upper one is strapped with a thimble in the strap--reeve the
yard-rope through the thimble, and then through the lower block, up
through the upper one, and on deck through a leader.

=230.=--FORE STORM-STAYSAIL GEAR.

_To fit the stay._--Take a piece of good rope of proportionable size
to the sail; fit one end with two legs as a stay, and lash them abaft
the foremast-head, the legs being placed underneath those of the
standing-stay. Take a piece of rope the round of the bowsprit, inside
the fore-stay collar; splice an eye in each end, and seize a thimble in
the bight--splice a lashing in one eye, and secure the strap round the
bowsprit, by passing it through both eyes, until sufficient turns are
taken to secure it. Reeve the end of this stay through the hanks for
the sail, then reeve it through the thimble in the strap, and set it
well up with a luff-purchase; the double block hooked to a strap well
up the stay, the single one to another strap on the end; then pass a
round-seizing round both parts, close to the thimble--come up the luff,
and pass another seizing between it and the end, but not at too great a
distance, as it will prevent the sail from coming close down.

_Halliards._--Have a good strap to go round the foremast-head, close
to the stay. It can be fitted with two lashing-eyes, and when so
fitted can be easier taken off, and put on. When the sail is to be
set, hook the double block of a luff-tackle to this strap, and the
single one to the head of the sail; the hauling-part being sent down
abaft the fore-yard, and through a leading block on deck.

_Downhaul._--A single block is secured to the parts of the strap
round the bowsprit--the downhaul is spliced to the head of the sail,
then rove through the hanks, through the single block, and led in on
the forecastle. When a stay is fitted, the downhaul block is seized
to the strap round the bowsprit.

The downhaul is often double; if so, a single block is secured to the
head of the sail, the standing-part of the downhaul secured to the
strap on the bowsprit, and the hauling-part led in as before.

_Sheets._--Deck-tackles are generally used, one on each side; they
are hooked to the clew of the sail, and the hooks well moused. When
the sheet is aft, the weather one is overhauled. The after blocks
are hooked to eye or ring-bolts, as convenient, and should not be
too high or too low; if too much up and down, they slack the foot of
the sail; if too high, the after leech. The falls are rove through
leading blocks, and all the hooks should be well moused.

_Note._--These stays when set up, may be secured cutter-stay-fashion,
instead of seizing the end up, which will allow the sail to haul
close down on the bowsprit.

=231.=--MAIN STAYSAIL GEAR.

The stay is fitted the same as the fore, and sets up round the
cross-piece in the fore bitts, after being rove through the hanks.

The halliards are fitted the same as the fore.

The downhaul is rove through a block strapped round the bitts for the
purpose. If rove double they are fitted in the same manner.

Instead of iron hanks, I have seen grommets used, made of pieces of
rope, with a wall-knot worked on one end, and an eye spliced in the
other; these are long enough to go round the stay and becket. They are
secured to eyelet-holes in the sail with a seizing, and are always kept
to it. I have seen the sails set on the spring-stays, when fitted in
this way, but prefer separate stays.

There are also other ways of setting storm-staysails, but those I have
mentioned are in most general use. When a main-trysail can be got,
mizen-staysails should never be drawn, as a ship will keep much better
to windward with trysails and fore-staysail, than under the staysails
alone.

=232.=--MIZEN-STAYSAIL GEAR.

The halliards are hitched to the collar of the staysail-stay, rove
through a block in the head of the sail, then through a leader, and led
down on deck.

The downhaul is clinched to the head of the sail, and rove through
the hanks down the mizen-stay. The mizen staysail-sheet is a runner,
leading through a snatch-block and thimble. A gun-tackle purchase is
most commonly used, which answers all purposes.

=233.=--TOPMAST STAYSAILS, &c., &c.

_Fore._--The standing part of the halliards is seized or hitched to the
fore topmast spring-stay, then rove through a block in the head of the
sail, up through a leading block under the eyes of the topmast rigging,
then down on the larboard side of the deck abaft the foremast. The
downhaul is hitched to the head of the sail, rove through the hanks,
then through a block seized to the tack of the sail, and led in on the
forecastle, through a fair leader. The tack is a simple lashing.

The fore topmast staysail and jib-sheets are pendants lashed to the
clew of the sail, with a block in the end, through which the sheets are
rove; the standing part is hooked to an eyebolt in the bows, and the
running part is led in on the forecastle.

_Main._--The standing part of the halliards is hitched to the collar
of the main-topmast spring-stay, reeving through a block at the head
of the sail, then through a block at the main-topmast head, and
led down on deck. The downhaul is fitted the same as the fore, and
led down by the fore-mast. The tack is rove through a block in the
weather fore-rigging, or top.

The main topmast staysail-brails are seized to the leech of the sail,
led up through the hanks to a block seized to the upper hank, and can
also be used as a downhaul.

The middle, lower, and upper topgallant-staysails and jackstays,
may be fitted in one. In this case a double block is turned in,
and lashed to the after part of the fore-topmast crosstrees, or
mast-head; the lower part is set up in the fore-top, and the upper
part at the fore-topgallant mast-head.

The middle staysail-stays are rove through a single block, strapped
to the topmast, down on the cap.

The lower and upper topgallant staysail-stays, are rove through
blocks fitted to traverse the jackstay, with lock-thimbles, the
former being rove through the other sheave of the double block
at the topmast cross-trees; the latter through a block at the
fore-topgallant mast-head, and both led on deck.

The downhaul blocks are single, and are seized to the straps of the
tricing-line blocks. The halliards are whips hitched to the collars
of the stays, rove through blocks in the head of the sail, through
leading blocks at the mast-head, and down on deck. The tacks are
single and led in the fore-top; the sheets are also single, leading
in the gangways.

_Note._--The principle object to be attended to, in reeving
running-rigging, is to avoid the ropes being too much crowded in one
place, crossing or chafing each other, or any part of the standing
rigging, as it not only destroys it, but also decreases the desired
purchase to be obtained by their running clear of each other.

=234.=--SETTING UP RIGGING FOR A FULL-DUE.

[Illustration]

Have all the luffs on deck; fore, main, and mizen pendant-tackles
hooked, and tackle-falls laid along for pulling up; new lanyards
ready for reeving, seizings, marling-spikes, levers, mallets, grease,
small spars for ratling-down, triangles rigged ready for hoisting
up the mast, to secure the futtock-shrouds and cat-harpen legs, (if
used;) burton-falls sent on deck and rove--all the temporary ratlines
cast-off--spars got up underneath the bowsprit with the gratings for
the men to work on--topgallant-masts and flying jib-boom housed;
and also men stationed at the dead-eyes to turn in if required. Let
everything go abaft the masts, commence turning in the dead-eyes, and
reeve the lanyards--set up the bowsprit-rigging and secure it. Then
man the pendant-tackles, set taut the after-swifters--(if wedges in)
get the mast well forward in its place, and secure the stays. Cast off
the cat-harpen legs (if fitted), and futtock-shrouds.[23] Set up the
rigging for a full-due, observing the same precautions as when it was
first set up.

The lanyard is now rove full, and when racked, take the end and form a
clove-hitch above the dead-eye, then rack the surplus-end to the inside
parts of the lanyard, until the end is expended. The hitch is formed
between the dead-eye and shroud, around both parts, in the space left
by stretching--some use a half-hitch taken over all round the shroud,
hove well back, the lanyard expended, and the end seized. The ends of
the shrouds are then cut square and capped, and the mats laced on.

Rigging-mats are made with small rope, three-quarter-inch, and are
called sword-mats. They are generally the breadth of the dead-eye, and
long enough to take in both--the lanyards are laced inside. They are
hardly ever used on topmast rigging; they look heavy, and are of no
use, except on the forward shrouds and backstays.

[23] Vessels having their futtock-rigging set up to bands round the
mast, use no cat-harpen legs, and have therefore no occasion of
coming up either of the above.

=235.=--STAYING MASTS.

The practice of “staying masts with the wedges in,” has been already
denounced as contrary to every received system of seamanship. The
stays may be set taut with the wedges in, but the masts should be
always free in the partners, whenever there is occasion to alter the
position of their _standing_; because it is impossible but that the
precise situation of the mast must be altered a little, rendering
necessary corresponding alterations in the wedges. When these are made
and the wedges firmly fixed, there can be no inequalities of play
or pressure--the whole becomes a solid mass, yielding naturally and
uniformly to the motion of the ship. Whereas, if in setting up the
rigging the wedges be kept fast, the mast pressing unequally against
them, having too much play in one part, and too little in another, it
must inevitably get crippled.

In preparing to set up the rigging, though the stays may not appear
to require a pull, it is well to have the luffs and tackle ready; for
after lifting the wedges, there is great probability of its being found
necessary.

=236.=--BLACKING RIGGING.

The most convenient method of blacking rigging, is with the topgallant
masts on deck, but royal and topgallant rigging placed at the
mast-heads; for then men who ride down and black the topmast-stays, can
then at the same time easily black the topgallant and royal-stays; or,
what is handier still--let the men at the mast-head haul over and black
these small stays, and pay them down forward when done. The men also
who black down the topmast-backstays, can carry on at the same time
with the topgallant and royal-backstays. By this method the masts are
kept clean.

[Illustration: Scale-draft of a First-Class Frigate.]

If, on the other hand, topgallant-masts be kept up when blacking, the
small stays and backstays must be let go, in order that they may be
got at by the men on the topmast-stays and backstays; consequently the
masts must be adrift, are likely to be daubed over with blacking, and
if it should come on to blow fresh, so as to render it necessary to get
the topgallant-masts on deck, much injury must result to the blacking.

The topsail and lower lifts should be blackened first, the men having
to stand on the yards to do them.

Previous to commencing, the decks should be well sanded, and the
paint-work and head covered with old canvass. The quarter-tackle should
be clapped on one side of the main-yard, and also a burton hooked,
ready for clearing boats.

The finer and warmer the day, the better--the blacking will lay on so
much the smoother and thinner; but commencement should be delayed until
the dew is well dried off. A dry calm day is the best; for the blacking
will not take effect, unless the surface it is laid upon be dry.

=237.=--STATIONING THE CREW.

In dividing the crew into watches, care should be taken that the
physical force is as equally distributed as possible, and that there be
as many seamen, ordinary seamen, boys, and marines, in one watch as in
another.

Petty officers should be chosen from among the seamen, and those
selected who have been long in the service, and have proved faithful.
Forecastle men should be middle-aged seamen, with a few ordinary seamen
and landsmen. Young active seamen should be selected for topmen, also
a few ordinary seamen, landsmen and boys. After-guard, a few elderly
seamen, with ordinary seamen and landsmen. Waisters are chiefly
landsmen, with a few ordinary seamen; in single-decked vessels, where
there are no waisters, more men should be stationed on the forecastle
and in the after-guard, in proportion to the number of the crew of
the different classes of vessels. Idlers are excused from keeping
watch--they are officers’ servants, cooks, &c., &c.

Divide each watch into first and second parts, and appoint a captain
to each part; number the men belonging to the forecastle, having all
the larboard watch even, as two, four, six, and the starboard odd; have
the numbers painted on canvass, and let each man sew it on his bag and
hammock; having also for greater distinction, the larboard painted red,
and the starboard black. The men should be below alternately, so that
when one watch is below, there should be an equal number of the other
watch on deck.

[Illustration]

=238.=--STATIONING THE CREW AT QUARTERS.

Captains of the guns should be chosen from among the seamen who have
been long accustomed to them, steady, with good sight, and quick
motion. The largest and stoutest men should be chosen to man the long
guns, the others the cannonades. The boarders should be stout men--the
firemen and sail-trimmers, active young men. Be particular to station
them as near where they are accustomed to do their duty as possible, in
order to prevent confusion. Let all the first part of the gun’s crew be
in one watch, and the second part in the other, so that in the event of
going to quarters in the night, the watch on deck can clear away the
guns, while the watch below will clear away the hammocks.

To a twelve-pounder cannonade are stationed four men and one boy. All
the men stationed at the long guns of a double-decked ship, should be
armed with cutlasses, and called “boarders”--the first of the gun’s
crew to be called second boarders, and _vice versa_. They are only to
be called on when required to “board,” or in a case of great emergency
to “repel boarders,” and then every man will repair to the upper-deck,
except the firemen, quarter-gunners, and powder boys, who will remain
below to protect the ports, or to assist in extinguishing a fire.

All the men stationed at the cannonades should be boarders and
sail-trimmers. As boarders, the first part should be armed with pikes;
the second part with small-arms, who are to repel the boarders, but not
to quit the ship.

In a single-decked ship, all the men stationed are boarders; the first
part to be armed with cutlasses, and the second with pikes.

The battery being manned, distribute the rest of the crew as
follows:--have a quarter-master at the signals, when in a
squadron--topmen and marines in the tops, to repair damages, and
act as small-arm-men--a quarter-master and two men at the relieving
tackles--men stationed at the passages, to pass full and empty
boxes; also others at the shot-lockers. Mastmen to see the rigging
clear--cook, and armorer at the galley--the carpenter and his mates at
the pumps and wings--the master-at-arms, and ship’s corporal in the
light-room--the gunner, his mates, quarter-gunners, and cooper, in the
magazine, and the surgeon and assistants in the cock-pit.

=239.=--STATIONING THE CREW FOR MOORING AND UNMOORING.

In stationing the men, place the same number of men, of each watch, to
perform a piece of duty. When in a squadron, have quarter-masters at
the signals, and also in the chains--men at the wheel--quarter-gunners
to overhaul the fish, and grapple the buoys--men to overhaul and hook
the cat, and attend the back-ropes; also others at the mast, to see
the rigging clear. Boatswain’s mates in the gangways; carpenter’s
mates to ship and unship the capstan bars, and attend the stanchions,
with the music at the capstan--some fore-topmen to put on nippers,
or selvagees, some main-topmen to take them off, and boys to carry
them forward. Hands to rouse up and veer away the cable, to attend
the stoppers, and light forward the messenger. The yeoman in the
store-room--master-at-arms, and ship’s corporal on the berth-deck, and
cook at the galley--tierces in each tier, or chain-locker, and the
remainder of the men at the capstan.

=240.=--LOOSING AND FURLING.

Take the same number of men from each watch, and station them at the
same rope, &c. The topmen are to man their respective yards--hands
are to attend the boom-jiggers and tricing-lines--forecastle men to
attend head-sails, trysail and foresail--main-yard men to look out for
the main-sail--after-guard, for the spanker and main-trysail--for the
main-topmast staysail, the fore-top-men--for the main-staysail, the
gunner’s crew--hand stationed to sheet home, and hoist the topsails,
and when coming to an anchor, the same men to man the clew-lines,
bunt-lines, and weather-braces; and when loosing sails to dry, to man
bowlines, or buntlines. In furling, the captains are to be in the
bunt, in reefing, at the earings.

=241.=--STATIONING THE CREW FOR TACKING AND VEERING.

Station the men from the “watch bill”--have hands at the jib-boom end,
to overhaul the jib-brails, and light over flying-jib sheets. On the
bowsprit end to light over jib-pendants--hands on the bumkins, and
in the chains, to overhaul tacks and sheets, and backstay-falls. On
deck, at the wheel, spritsail-braces, jib-sheets, jib-brails, braces,
bow-lines, clew-garnets, tacks and sheets, backstay-falls, lifts,
trusses, spanker-sheets, guys, vangs, and topping-lifts. Aloft, to
overhaul lifts and trusses--attend outriggers, and bear the backstays
abaft and abreast--the mast-men to see the rigging clear, &c., &c.

_For reefing._--The men are stationed as in furling, with the
exception of the captains, who are stationed at the earings. When the
yards are down, the men from the clew-lines and bunt-lines will haul
out the reef-tackles.

=242.=--GETTING READY TO BEND SAILS.

It is customary to bend the light sails first, such as jibs, spankers,
and trysails. Overhaul the jib and flying-jib stay, and halliards, in
on the forecastle. Have the lashing spliced into the sheets ready for
passing, and seizings to the hanks.

Overhaul down into the top the reef-tackles, and stop the blocks to the
foremost shrouds, (or the end if single.) Overhaul the topsail-sheets
from the yard-arm, and half-hitch them round a dead-eye, or foremost
futtock-plate. Bunt-lines into the top, and stop them to the foremost
shroud, above the topsail-yard, or to the tye-blocks--clew-lines
into the top, and stop them to the eye of a shroud, and get the
harbor-gaskets on the yards. A rope-yarn stop will be quite sufficient
for all these purposes. Both burtons should be overhauled on deck
before all.

Overhaul down the leech-lines, slab-lines, bunt-lines and clew-garnets,
and stop them so as to prevent their flying about.

Take two selvagee-straps, put them round the neck of the boom-irons,
and to them hook the double-block of a long jigger; the single one
overhaul down, and hook to a ring or eye-bolt in the bulwarks, and the
fall led through a leading block a-midships.

[Illustration: United States’ Ship-of-the-Line COLUMBUS, at Anchor.]

Lower down the gaffs--overhaul the brails, and have seizings of
two-yarn spun-yarn ready, to secure them to the sails. If hoops,
seizings should also be put on them, with both ends rove through the
bight.

Topgallant yards should be got out of the rigging, and laid on deck out
of the way, ready for bending the sails. Top-burtons overhauled down
forward of all, for the topsails.

_Note._--When the preparations above stated are made, it is intended
to bend all the sails together.

=243.=--BENDING SAILS.

Call all hands to bend sails--get the courses, jib, topsails, and
spanker, on deck. Open them out, and see that they are whole and
complete; with the bowline-bridles, head and reef-earings, rope-bands,
reef-points, sheet, clew-line, and reef-tackle blocks all in their
proper places. Bight the topsails down in their respective places
forward of the masts, with the clews out. Hook the lower block of the
burton to the slings passed round the centre of the sail, and mouse the
hook--reeve the fall through a snatch-block or leader, and keep the
sail clear of the top as it goes up.

Overhaul the courses athwart the deck, shackle on the sheet, and
also the tack, and clew-garnet blocks--reeve and bend the gear--stop
the head of the sail to the bunt-lines, use the clew-jiggers for
yard-ropes, hooking to the first reef-cringle, and stop the head
earings to the block.

The end of the jib-stay having been brought in on the forecastle,
reeve in the hanks, and stop the luff of the jib--hook on the
halliards--reeve the downhauls--fit the brail-block and reeve the
brails--hook on the sheet-blocks, or pendants, and reeve the sheets.

Lower the spanker-gaff--pass the throat and peak-earings, and lace
the head to the gaff--seize on the brails, and reeve them and the
outhauler. All being ready,

_To man the gear._--First, man the top-burtons and sway the topsails
clear of the deck--man the jib-halliards and downhaul--yard-ropes,
clew-garnets, clew-lines, bunt-lines, reef-tackles, and
gaff-halliards: at the word run out the jib, reeve and set up the
stay, and seize the tack. Sway the topsails and courses up to the
yards, where some hands are ready to receive them. Bend the gear
and haul out; then take a turn with the earings--ride down the heads
and pass the earings exactly; make fast the rope-bands, fit the
leech-line block of the courses--seize on and reeve the leech-line.
In the mean-time some hands are employed in seizing on the hoops of
the trysails and spanker, as they go aloft. After the sails are all
bent, it would be well to let them fall, to see that all the gear is
bent clear, if so, clew up and furl the courses and topsails, and
stow the jib, spanker and trysails.

The topgallant-sails, royals, and studding-sails are bent on deck.

Send the staysails into the tops, fit the jackstays and tricing-line
blocks, seize the head of the luff; reeve the halliards, downhauls,
and brails, bend the tacks and sheets; stow the staysails and haul
all taut.

_Note._--The staysails are not _all_ allowed by the new Book of
Allowances.

=244.=--BENDING SMALL SAILS.

By small sails are meant topgallant-sails, royals, flying-jib,
studding-sails and staysails.

It is only in ships in good order where the men go through this
manœuvre with smartness and method, after being exercised, and having
become familiar with the ship and their stations.

First, all the yards, topgallant, royal, and studding-sail, should be
got out of the rigging, and down on deck at the same time. Next, a
proportion of hands should be sent to each sail, and all bent together,
including flying-jib and staysails.

When the topgallant-sails, royals, and studding-sails, are all bent,
they should be swayed into the rigging all together, and not one after
another.

If the topgallant-yards happen to be across, the best plan, if
circumstances will permit, is to bend all the other small sails first,
except the flying-jib, and then to wait until the yards are sent down
at sunset, to bend topgallant-sails and flying-jib.

Topgallant sails ought not to be bent while the yards are across,
because the earings must then be hauled out, and passed _over_ the
lifts and braces, which precludes the possibility of unrigging the yard
afterwards, without unbending the sail. Sometimes one of the two sets
of topgallant-yards are appropriated in harbor to exercise, (sending up
and down) while the other is kept below, with the sail bent, ready for
crossing.

In bending topgallant-sails, the earings are passed the same as the
topsail, and the sail seized to the jackstay, the yard-rope bent, the
sails furled, and the yard got into the lower rigging. In furling,
bring the leeches taut along the yard, and keep the clews in the bunt,
then roll the sail up from the yard-arm, and pass the gaskets. Put
the grommet over the yard-arm, man the yard-rope and sway the yard up
and down; put the lower yard-arm into the snotter, over the foremost
dead-eye; secure the upper yard-arm with a lanyard spliced round the
shroud for the purpose; it is called a stop. The lizard should be
singled, ready for going aloft, by reeving it once through the thimble
on the yard-arm, and half-hitch round the yard-rope with the bight.

Trysails and storm-staysails should be bent at this time, if they are
to be bent at all before leaving harbor.

_Note._--Good rope-yarns answer very well for robins for
topgallant-sails and royals. You are never at a loss for them in
bending, and in unbending they are easily cut.

=245.=--BENDING A SPANKER.

Overhaul the brails well, and pass the sail through their bights. Haul
the earing in the jaws out first; then the outer one. Splice the lacing
into the outer eyelet-hole, lacing, and secure the lacing in the jaws.
Bring the after-leech taut, along the gaff, and within a few inches of
the blocks; mark the place for the throat-brails, also for the peak,
opposite their respective cheeks on the gaff, and seize the brails to
the leech-rope, by passing the seizing between the strands and round
the brails. Eyelet-holes, worked close to the leech-rope, are far
preferable for seizing the brails to.

The throat-earing is generally passed through an eye-bolt in the lower
part of the jaws; but this never brings the sail close to the mast, and
looks very bad. In preference, I would recommend having a score cut
under the leather in the jaws, and the earing passed from the cringle
through this score, and an eye-bolt on the upper side of the jaws,
back through the cringle, and so on, until sufficient turns are taken
to secure the sail. Large staples also are fitted to the jaws for the
purpose, and keys on top, which answer better, and are more secure;
also bending battens, instead of lacing round the gaff.

The outer earing is passed round a cleat on the upper side of the
gaff, for the purpose. Take the earing from the cringle, pass it round
outside the cleat, back through the cringle, and round the cleat, until
sufficient turns are taken; then take several inner turns round the
gaff and cringle; frap all the outer turns together, with the remaining
part of the earing, to bring the parts close, and prevent any chance of
their slipping over the cleat; take two half-hitches, expend, and seize
the end.

To haul out this earing, and stretch the head of the sail well, use a
small jigger; secure the double block to an eye-bolt in the end of the
gaff, pass three turns of the earing, cat’s-paw the end, to which hook
the other block, and pull the earing well out. I have frequently seen
only one earing used; but would prefer two, as all inner turns, when
much strain is on them, should have a separate earing. If a new sail,
and requires much stretching, it is hauled well out before passing the
earing, by hooking the inner block of the jigger to the cringle. Man
the throat and peak-halliards, hoist the sail up gradually, seize the
hoops, and reeve the lacing.

_Note._--Trysails are bent in the same manner. Some fit them to haul
_in_ and _out_ on the gaff, with hoops.

=246.=--FITTING SEA-GASKETS.

Gaskets are made with foxes, or small spun-yarn, and platted, like
making sennit. The spun-yarn is middled over the bolt, and platted
together, the bight forming the eye; sometimes a piece is platted for
the eye, then all worked together; if not, the eye is served over
afterwards. Sea-gaskets are long enough to have only two on each
yard-arm, and to furl the sail over booms and all, when close-reefed,
as there will be no more sail on the yard-arms than at any other time.
They are secured round the jackstay, by reeving the end through the
eye; sometimes round the yard.

=247.=--FITTING HARBOR-GASKETS.

In making, the eye is left large enough to take a small thimble, then
platted broader in the centre, and tapered to a small end. The broad
part should be long enough to make the sail in when furled with two
reefs. They may be (to look well) about two-and-a-half inches wide,
but this is quite a matter of taste. When put on the yard, the thimble
is put underneath the jackstay from forward, and secured to it by a
seizing passed round the neck of the gasket and jackstay, close to the
thimble, and when the sail is ready for their being passed, it is taken
up and rove through the thimble, and the sail tossed well up; the end
then shoved underneath between the sail and gasket, once or twice.
These always look better than any other, are easier passed and secured,
and keep the sail well up. There is generally one harbor-gasket to
every other seam.

=248.=--BUNT-GASKETS.

These are always, as to fitting, a matter of taste, but at present
they are generally made of wove mat, two or three inches wide, with
the two legs crossed, and an eye in each end. I have seen them made
of rope, in the following manner:--Take the distance between the two
quarter blocks, and measure it off on deck; drive a nail slightly into
the deck at each end; then measure from the centre the height the
bunt is intended to be, and there drive another nail. Take a piece of
rope, from two and a half to three-inch, and measure off sufficient to
go over these nails, forming a triangle; splice both ends together,
and seize a thimble in each corner; put these thimbles over the nails
again, and fill the space in diamonds or squares, according to fancy.
The thimbles in each end are secured by the quarter-blocks to the
jackstay, and also in the centre. It is not necessary to have thimbles
in each end, as an eye will answer every purpose. A long sennit-gasket
is middled and seized by the upper thimble; it should be sufficiently
long to go round the mast, when the gasket is boused up, to secure it
and the bunt well into the mast.

=249.=--HAMMOCK GIRTLINES.

Whips are rove at the yard-arms. If rope is not used on purpose for
girtlines, the studding-sail halliards will answer; they are rove as
follows:--A tail block is put on each side of the jib-boom end, and
another on the spanker-boom. Overhaul down the whips, and bend them
round the girtlines with a bowline knot, allowing room for their
rendering through. Belay the foremost ends of the girtlines and trice
up; haul upon the after-part, and get all taut. A man lays out on each
yard-arm, and marks the girtline with rope-yarns where the tricing
line, or a whip, should be bent; then lower away, cast off the bowline
knot, and bend the tricing lines round the girtlines with a rolling
hitch.

The whips are led from the lower yards to the lower caps, through
blocks hooked to the bolts, and on deck. The lower end of the
tricing-line is often bent to the girt-line as an inhaul or downhaul;
but it is best to have them separate, as it prevents walking the
hammocks up, and laying across the deck; and there are plenty of other
ropes’ ends which will answer the same purpose.

When one girt-line of a side is not enough, others are rove inside in
the same manner. The generality of ships reeve them inside of the lower
rigging, as they are much easier got down, and the hammocks are not so
likely to get dirty, or overboard.

=250.=--STOPPING ON HAMMOCKS.

Every man should be obliged to have three knittle-stops at the head,
and two at the foot of his hammock. When stopping on, they should
overlay at each side about two or three inches, and be stopped together
at the foot--numbers up and in.

The forecastle-men should stop their hammocks on forward, next
foretop-men, next maintop-men, next mizentop-men, next after-guard,
idlers, and boys. Boatswain’s mates abreast of each hatchway.

=251.=--FURLING OR STOWING THE BUNT OF A SAIL.

When the sail is nearly rolled up, hook the bunt-jigger, bouse it
well up, lower the buntlines, and _shove_ the sail well into the
skin, taking pains to keep the bunt square; pass and secure the
bunt-gasket--take off the jigger--lower and square the studding-sail
booms, and pass the heel-lashings.

=252.=--FURLING COURSES.

The leeches are handed in along the yard, then the sail rolled up snug,
with the ends of the points passed in towards the bunt, to give the
sail a gradual increase in that direction. Pass the gaskets, lower the
booms, and, if required, stop up the gear.

Bowlines are stopped to the slings close down, and hauled taut on the
forecastle.

The bowline-bridles of all sails, in furling, are laid with the toggle
towards the bunt, and bridles taut along the yard.

When a sail is neatly furled, it appears neither above nor below the
yard--earings well slewed up--sail smooth under the gaskets, bunt
square, and a _taut_ skin. The heels of the booms should be square, and
every thing necessary completed, previous to _squaring_ the yards.

=253.=--MAKING UP SAILS.

In making up a course, stretch the head of the sail well taut along
the deck or loft; bring up to the head the belly-band, then the foot,
leaving the clew-blocks out at each end; also the bowline-bridles, and
roll taut up; pass the head-earing round the sail close inside the
bolt-rope, and put a stop of good spun-yarn to every seam. The reef
earings are made up in the sail.

In making up a topsail, stretch the head of the sail taut along; bring
the second reef up to the head, and lay all the points and earings
snugly along; then bring up the belly-band, and then the foot. The
clew-blocks, bowline-bridles, reef-tackles, and toggles or span,
should be left out, so that when the sail is sent aloft for bending,
the sheets can be rove, reef-tackles and bowlines toggled, without
loosing the sail, which will be found of great advantage when blowing
fresh. Roll well up, stop with spun-yarn at each seam, and expend the
head-earings round the ends of the sail.

Topgallant-sails are made up with the clews out, and bowline-bridles,
(if wished,) but they are always bent to the yards on deck; so the
neater, they can be made up the better.

_Note._--The reef-earings of the topsails should be secured to the
cringles, before rolling up; bowline-hitch the end of the first
reef-earing to the head, second to the first, third to the second,
and fourth to the third reef cringles; as there is sometimes much
trouble in getting hold of an earing when it is not secured as above.

All spare sails should be _tallied_, before being stowed in the
sail-room, as it will prevent all mistakes; but if a sail is properly
stowed, and the _master_ and _sailmaker_ take a list when they are
stowing, there never can be any difficulty in finding what may be
wanted.

Royals are made up the same as topgallant-sails.

=254.=--TO MAKE UP A TOPMAST STUDDING-SAIL.

Stretch the sail taut along, and overhaul the downhaul through the
thimble and block, and bight it along the whole length of the leech.
Then roll up towards the inner leech, lay the sheets along the whole
length of the sail, roll up over all, and stop the sail well up with
spun-yarn or foxes. The earings are expended round the head of the sail
when bent to the yard.

_Note._--The topgallant studding-sail is also made up in the same
manner.

=255.=--FURLING FORE AND AFT SAILS, (WITH CLOTHS OR COVERS.)

The jib is hauled close down, and the sea-gasket passed round it. The
cloth is then placed over, and the stops tied. Eyelet-holes are made in
each edge for the stops. Jib-sheets and halliards stopped, and hauled
taut.

_Furling Spanker._--It is also furled best with a cover; it can be
furled in the two after cloths, the same as a jib, but it never looks
so well, takes time, and in most instances has to be loosed two or
three times before it gives satisfaction.

In furling with a cover, the sail is brailed close up, and the cover
stopped round, commencing from the end of the gaff, and working in to
the mast, and down on deck.

Trysails are stowed in the same manner as spankers.

The fore-topmast staysail is stowed as a jib, in the netting.[24]

_Note._--Stowing fore and aft sails requires more handy-work than
seamanship, the principal thing being to furl them in the smallest
compass, and in the after cloths, as it brings the seams up and down.
I have seen staysails admired for their neatness from the deck,
when the greater part of the sails were lying loose in the top.
This should be avoided as much as possible, as something should be
sacrificed in appearance, to preserve a sail from injury. Taking a
little trouble will get all the sail in the skin; and although it may
be larger, it can be made to look neat.

Jibs require more pains taken in stowing, than any of the other fore
and aft sails. There is no necessity of stowing them in their own
cloths, when furling cloths are allowed. (_See allowance_).

[24] Canvass bottoms are used instead of nettings, for staysails.

=256.=--REEFING COURSES TO JACKSTAYS.

When this plan is adopted there is only one point requisite, and that
on the fore side of the sail; some use two, but it is unnecessary.

Reeve the point through the eyelet-hole from the after side, the points
being made with eyes. Through the eyes reeve a small sized rope; this
is called the jack-line. Between every four eyelet-holes, stitch the
rope well to the sail, on each yard-arm, leaving three points out.
Take a piece of small rope, splice one end to the eyelet-hole in the
head of the sail, reeve it through that left in the reef, and splice
the other end into the same eyelet hole in the head, leaving about two
feet slack. This will be found of much use in gathering the sail up for
reefing--it is called a _grab-rope_, or _reef-line_.

=257.=--REEF-EARINGS

Are fitted the same as the head--an eyelet-hole is worked below the
cringle, large enough to take the earing; through this put the earing,
reeve the end through the long-eye, and haul it taut through. The
earings are sometimes put in the cringles, but the cringle cannot be
so well hauled up on the yard, and consequently will not be so well
secured for carrying sail; and it not only puts more strain on the
yard-arm points, but also injures the sail. They are also fitted on the
bight, and passed on both ends; one end for the outer turns, and the
other the inner turns.

_To pass a reef-earing._--For the first, second, and third reef,
take it from the sail, on the foreside of the yard, round the cleat
for the purpose, through the cringle, round the yard and through the
cringle, until three or four outer turns are passed; then reeve the
bight through the cringle from aft forward--take a round turn in the
cringle; then take the end from the latter under the yard up abaft
over, and through the bight; then back over the yard on the foreside,
through the cringle, from underneath the yard; slew the cringle well
up, and leech off the sail, and pass sufficient turns to secure;
then expend the end round the yard and half-hitch round all, or a
clove-hitch to the lift.

A close reef-earing is passed the same way, but hauled out on the
after side of the yard. Being hauled out abaft, it covers all the
other reefs, and there being so much sail on the fore-side, it would
never keep up.

In passing the outer turns for each reef, take two for the first;
three for the second and third, and four for the fourth. For the
inner turns, expend the earing, except your earings are fitted on the
bight.

=258.=-BENDING STUDDING-SAILS.

All are bent to the yard alike, and the same precautions used as in
other sails, keeping the rope next the yard. The earings are rove
through the holes in the yard-arms, and cringle in the head of the
sails; two or three outer turns are taken, and the earing nearly
expended in inner turns, then frap the outer turns together with the
end, and half-hitch, if the sail is laced to the yard--the lacing is
spliced into one eyelet-hole, rove through the other, and passed round
the yard.

They are sometimes bent by half-hitching the lacing, which plan keeps
the sail up, and much closer to the yard. A round turn is also used, by
being passed round the yard-arm and through the eyelet-hole twice, and
from the latter through the next eyelet-hole, round the yard. They are
then made up--the topmast studding-sail to the foremost shrouds of fore
and main rigging; topgallant, in foremost part of the topmast rigging;
and lower, on the booms. The topmast studding-sail is also sometimes
kept on the booms, and tarpaulin covers fitted for them.

These sails are sometimes bent with long rope-bands, and unbent when
taken in and stowed away, if dry.

[Illustration]

In making up a topmast studding-sail, when bent, overhaul the downhaul
the length of the luff or outer leech; then take the foot up to the
yard, and place the tack block out. Bight the downhaul along the yard,
also the sheets; roll the sail snugly up, and stop it with yarns.

Lower studding-sails are bent and made up in the same manner as topmast
studding-sails, with the sheet in.

I have seen these sails when placed in the rigging ready for setting,
with the sheets and downhaul left out and stopped to the yards; the
tack stopped from the lower yard, up and down the foremost shroud and
bent to the sail. This was done with the idea that the sail could be
set much quicker; but it was found that the sail on the opposite side
(which was set in the general way), was set with less trouble, and in
less time. There will be plenty of time to bend the tack and halliards
(when the order is given to get ready), while getting burtons up,
jiggers on topsail-lift, weather-braces taut, and rigging the booms out.

_Note._--The topgallant studding-sail tack is generally kept bent,
and slacked when bracing the yards up.

It has frequently occurred to me, when I have heard the order from
the quarter-deck, in the event of setting studding-sails, “to rig out
and hoist away;” how can it be possible to rig out the fore-topmast
studding-sail booms, when probably there may be fifty men clapped on
the lower studding-sail halliards, hauling the booms in, and seldom
more than six or eight men at the most, on the in-and-out jigger,
trying to get the boom out.

I should recommend to rig-out and secure first, then hoist away.

=259.=--PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING THE WHARF AND HAULING OUT IN THE
STREAM.

_To haul off and moor ship._--Before hauling off, all the spare
spars should be hoisted in and secured, boat’s chocks placed,
all the stores, provisions, and water got on board; it would be
also well to see that there is a sufficient quantity of brooms,
bath-brick for cleaning bright-work, lime and size for whitewash,
and everything that is allowed and requisite for the ship. The
complement of men from the receiving ship should be got on board,
and the boats provided with crews, oars, and sails. When everything
necessary is completed, make preparations for hauling off. Get up
kedges and hawsers ready for instant service; have the ends of the
hawsers pointed up each hatchway, ready for handing out if wanted.
Run out a kedge, and drop it where the first, or weather-anchor is
to be planted; have lines from the ship to the shore--single the
fasts--hang over fenders and outriggers--man the hawser, cast off the
fasts, and warp off; checking her as may be necessary by the lines.
When warped out to the kedge, run it up to the bows, and let go the
weather anchor; veer as fast as she will take it, assisting her in
going astern by the mizen-topsail, if necessary. If to shoot her to
either side, use the helm, jib, or spanker, and in case there is no
wind, use kedges and hawsers.

When a double scope is out, stopper the cable, and let go the second
anchor--furl the mizen-topsail--bring-to on the weather cable, and
heave in to the moorings; moor a little taut, to allow for veering.
If a hemp-cable, clap on the service, and veer to the hawse-hole.

=260.=--CARRYING OUT AN ANCHOR WITH A BOAT.

Hang the anchor to the stern of the boat by good stoppers, and have the
buoy and buoy-rope attached to it; pass the end of the cable or hawser
out through the hawse-hole, and coil away enough of it in the bows
of the boat, to reach the bottom. Now capsize the coil in the stern
sheets, and then the end will be uppermost; bend on to the anchor.
There should also be a sufficient length of the hawser coiled away in
the boat to reach the place destined for the anchor. When in the right
place, heave over the buoy, and see that the buoy-rope is clear--stand
clear of the cable, and slip the stoppers. In case of making a
guess-warp, _vice versa_.

=261.=--MARKING THE LEAD-LINE.

At two fathoms, two strips of leather; at three fathoms, three strips
of leather; at five fathoms, a white rag; at seven fathoms, a red rag;
at ten fathoms, a piece of leather with a hole in it; at thirteen, the
same as three; at fifteen, the same as five; at seventeen, the same as
seven; at twenty fathoms, two knots.

Deep-sea lead-lines are marked the same, as far as twenty fathoms, then
add one knot for every ten fathoms, and a strip of leather for every
five fathoms.

[Illustration]

=262.=--HEAVING THE LEAD

A hole is made in the upper part of the lead, a piece of rope rove
through it, and both ends spliced together;[25] an eye is spliced in
the end of the line, put through this strap, the lead shoved through
the bight, and hauled taut.

[Illustration]

Breast ropes are fitted in the chains, for the men to lean against when
heaving the lead. They are made as sword-mats, tapered at each end, and
secured to two shrouds, with seizings passed round them, and through
the eyes in each.

Heaving the lead is generally performed by a man who stands in the
main chains to windward. Having the line all ready to run out, without
interruption, he holds it at a distance of nearly a fathom from the
lead, and having swung it backwards and forwards three or four times,
in order to acquire a greater velocity with the swing, he then swings
it over his head, and thence as far forward as is necessary; so that
by the lead sinking whilst the ship advances, the line may be almost
perpendicular when it reaches the bottom. The person sounding then
proclaims the depth of water, in a kind of _singing manner_. Thus:
if the mark of five fathoms is close to the surface of the water, he
_sings out_, “by the mark 5!” and, as there are no marks at 4, 6, 8,
&c., he estimates those numbers, and sings, “by the deep 4!” &c. If
he considers it to be a quarter, or a half, more than any particular
number, he sings out, “and a quarter 5!” “and a half 4!” &c. If he
conceives the depth to be three quarters more than a particular number,
he calls it a quarter less than the next; thus, at four fathoms and
three-quarters, he calls, “a quarter less 5!” and so on, according to
the depth of the water.

[25] A leather becket may be used for light leads, instead of a rope
strap.

=263.=--MARKING A LOG-LINE.

[Illustration]

Allow twelve fathoms for stray line, where stick in a white rag; then
at every forty-seven feet and six-tenths, mark the line as follows,
viz.: at one, one leather; at two, two knots; at three, three knots;
and also having a mark at every half-knot. The glasses should be proved
with a good watch, having a second-hand.

The principle of the log-line is, that a knot is the same part of a
sea-mile, that half-a-minute is of an hour; therefore the length of a
knot should be one-hundred-and-twentieth the length of a sea mile, or
fifty-one feet; but as it is more convenient to have the knot divided
into eight parts, of six feet each, the proportional reduction is
necessary in the glass. Therefore as 51 feet : 30 seconds :: 48 feet :
28, 4.17 seconds; but as the fraction can be more easily allowed in the
line than the glass, another proportion is necessary, viz., as 28, 4.17
seconds : 48 feet :: 28 seconds to 47.6 feet, or the length of a knot.

_Note._--Log-lines are kept on reels for the purpose.

The length of the stray-line is regulated by the size of the ship.

=264.=--GETTING READY FOR SEA.

Observe and note the exact line of flotation. See that all the rigging
is properly up, alow and aloft. See that the preventer-gear is on, as
well as breast-ropes for leadsmen, and leads and lines in the chains.
If requisite, grease the masts, jib and staysail-stays, lifts and
trusses, and reef-pendants--sheet-anchor stowed--guns secured--boats
hoisted in and secured. Care should be taken that the harness-casks are
lashed--chests and tables properly cleated, and binnacles secured. Let
the armorer examine the slip-stoppers, and see that they are oiled,
and in proper condition--get the swinging-booms fore and aft--awnings
below, and awning ridge-ropes down--down jack-staff--see that the
tiller-ropes are all clear, and that the tiller moves freely; also that
the relieving-tackles and spare tiller-ropes are at hand.

Cross topgallant yards, bend the gear; take the covers off the jibs,
staysail, spanker, and trysails, and coil every rope down clear, for
running--have the studding-sails stopped, ready for going aloft, and
the royal-halliards down on the weather side. Cat and fish overhauled
down. Timenoguys in their respective places. Life-buoys in order.
Accommodation-ladder unshipped and stowed away. Pendants and ladders
taken off the swinging-booms--head-cranes unshipped--chafing-gear on
its respective places. It would also be well to see that there is a
sufficiency of sand on board.

=265.=--CLEAR HAWSE.

[Illustration:

A Cross.
An Elbow.
A Round-turn.]

Call all hands to “clear hawse.” Lash a stout single-block to the
bowsprit, through which reeve the clear hawse-pendant; haul the launch
under the bows, or if there is too much sea on, or she is not out, send
a hand down in a bowline, and hook the pendant to the riding-cable,
below the turn; bouse them up clear of the water, after which pass a
stout lashing round both cables.

If there should be a heavy sea on, or the wind flawey and variable, it
would be well to pass the end of a hawser out of the hawse-hole, and
hitch it to the cable,[26] to relieve the lashing. Reeve ropes through
blocks on each side of the bowsprit end, for bow-lines, and pass them
in at the hawse-hole, so as to take out an elbow; for instance--suppose
the starboard was the clearing cable, take the larboard bow-line down
under the cable, up into the starboard hawse-hole, and the starboard
one over to the larboard side of the cable; then follow the lead of the
larboard bow-line, bend on several fathoms inside, and stop along to
the hawse-hole; draw the splice, or unshackle, bend on the hawse-rope,
off-stoppers, and run out; hang the bights to the bowsprit (if
hemp-cable), with slip-ropes, and send in the bow-lines again, the same
way as before. When the end is out, “cast off,” dip it fair, and bend
on again to the cable; rouse in, slack down the slip-ropes, and splice
or shackle the cable; haul it taut with a deck-tackle, and bitt, and
stopper as before. Cast off the hawser, unlash the cable, unreeve the
clear hawse-pendant, unlash the block from the bowsprit end, and clear
up the deck.

_Note._--If there is a round turn and an elbow in the hawse after
rousing the cable, repeat the operation as before; it is always well
to prevent confusion, by taking out one elbow at a time. A cross, is
when the cables lay across each other, or when the ship has _swung
foul once_; an elbow is two crosses, and a round turn is three
crosses; a round turn and elbow is five crosses. It can readily be
seen thus, in clearing hawse with a round turn, a cross will be left
in the cables.

The anchor is fouled in the very operation of _letting it go_; the
weight of the chain-cable causing the running out part to fall over
and foul the stock. To avoid this, some officers pursue the practice
of “letting go” the anchor with the cable _bitted_, which plan is
strongly recommended.

From the weight of the chain-cable, compared with that of the hempen,
the former is less liable than the latter to foul the anchor; but no
speculation should induce an officer to depart from that practice
which can alone ensure a clear anchor.

[26] See clear hawse-shackle and pendant.

=266.=--WEIGHING AN ANCHOR WITH THE LAUNCH.

This may be done by under-running, when the ship has slipped the cable,
or weighing by the buoy-rope, when the anchor is lying in too shoal
water for the ship to be hove up to it.

Ship the roller on the stern of the launch, have strong tackles with a
jigger also, and some good rope for stoppers. Get the end of the cable
over the roller; pass a strap round it, to which hook the double block
of the tackle, and the single one to a bolt in the bows; man the fall,
and as the cable comes in, French-flake it along the thwarts; when the
tackle comes two blocks, “stopper and fleet;” when the cable is “up
and down,” clap the jigger on the fall of the tackle, and heave the
boat’s stern well down in the water, and stopper securely. Send all the
men in the bows of the boat; jump the boat and break the anchor out of
the ground; then man the fall again, off stopper, and heave up; when
the ring of the anchor is above water, pass a short ring-stopper, haul
the buoy on board, and bring the boat to the ship; when alongside,
hook the cat, and cat the anchor. Get the end of the cable unclinched,
passed into the hawse, and the remainder hauled out of the launch. (If
chain-cable, unshackle.)

=267.=--WEIGHING AN ANCHOR WITH A BUOY-ROPE.

[Illustration]

Get the buoy-rope over the roller, clap on a tackle, and weigh the
anchor as before. When it is secured, man the capstan, heave the launch
in under the bows, and cat the anchor.

Anchors are generally weighed with the buoy-rope when the cable has
parted, and the end cannot be grappled; when this is the case, the
anchor may be weighed with launch, brought under the bows and catted,
and the cable unclinched and hove in; or the ship might be warped over
the buoy, and the cat-fall taken to the buoy-rope.

=268.=--BOATING AN ANCHOR.

[Illustration]

Place the flukes perpendicularly over the stern, and the stock
a-thwart-ships in the stem sheets, resting horizontally upon a loose
thwart, placed there previously for the purpose, and steady all by one
or two lashings.

In letting go, nothing more is required than to cant the anchor over
the quarter, by means of the thwart, taking care previously that the
buoy, buoy-rope, and cable, be perfectly clear.

Light anchors should be boated contrary to this, _i. e._, flukes
inboard, and stock out.

=269.=--TAKING IN A LAUNCH.

Brace and secure the yards the same as when getting up the anchors, and
also rig the same purchases; place the chocks, pass everything out of
the launch, and hook the purchases to spans; have a few hands in the
boat to keep her clear of the ship’s side. Man the yard tackle falls;
have some hands to take in the slack of the stay fall; “walk away;”
when the boat leaves the water, take out the plug. When high enough to
clear the waist anchor stock, haul over on the main stay, easing away
the fore and main yards; when the stem is over the deck, haul over the
fore stay, lower, and place her in the chocks.

The other boats may be got on board by the same purchases. The launch
is stowed on the larboard side; the first cutter on the starboard
side;[27] the second cutter, inside the launch, and the third cutter
inside the first. When all are in, unrig the purchases, square the
yards, and set up the gripes.

The quarter and stern boats are hoisted up to their davits, and secured
to them by stoppers, and the gripes set up.

[27] _i. e._, if the ship be a frigate or larger. Single-deck ships
have but one nest of boats.

=270.=--TAKING IN BOATS BOTH SIDES AT ONCE.

The yards are kept square, and secured on both sides by the lifts,
burtons, and quarter lifts. Use the winding and stay tackles for the
heaviest boats, and the yard tackles for the lightest ones; the topsail
halliards forward, and the main pendant tackle aft, acting as stays
to bring them on board. It may be necessary to come up the forward
backstays, as they would be likely to interfere with the bows of the
boats; after which proceed as before.

_Taking in a boat at sea._--Back the main-topsail, get the boat to
leeward, secure the lower yards as before directed, and hoist her in.
The boat coming in to leeward, tackles will be necessary to get her
to windward sufficiently to lower away.

When before the wind, a boat might be got in by securing the yards
as before, and taking a hawser from aft to the stern of the boat, to
keep her from sending or pitching forward when leaving the water, and
thereby endangering the yards.

_Note._--Some of our large vessels have two sets of yard and stay
tackles, for the purpose of taking in boats both sides at once; but
the above mentioned gear will answer all purposes in any case of
emergency, where the manœuvre is not considered as exercising.

PART IV.

=271.=--GETTING UNDER-WEIGH.

See that the hawse is clear; overhaul a range of the weather cable--get
up nippers--pass the messenger--knock up the stanchions--ship
the gratings--ship, and swifter-in the capstan bars--rig the
fish-davit--overhaul cat and fish; and call “all hands unmoor ship.”

When the cable grows with the angle of the main-stay, the ship
is said to ride at a “long stay;” when it grows with the angle
of the fore-stay, the ship is said to be at a “short-stay.” When
perpendicular, the phrase is “up and down.” From one or other of
the two last mentioned positions, sail is generally made in getting
under-weigh.

If from the nature of the ground, or strength of the wind, there should
be any probability of dragging the anchor, sail is generally made from
a “short stay.” In such a case, particular attention ought to be paid
that the head yards be not braced too sharp a-box; for the object being
to cant the ship with the least possible sternway, the sooner the head
sails lift or fill the better. The jibs are hoisted the instant they
will take. If, after all, the ship drags her anchor, you can pall the
capstan--stopper over all, brace round the head yards, and force her
a-head by the sails, as far as may be necessary; then back the head
yards, lay-to, and get the anchor up.

If there should be so much wind and sea, as to make it a matter of
difficulty to get the anchor, but plenty of sea-room, brace the yards
a-box, according to the tack you wish to go upon, and get the anchor
up and secured before making sail. In moderate weather, and ordinary
circumstances, sail is generally made when the cable is “up and down.”
Sometimes a stern-board is necessary, with the anchor dragging on the
ground; at other times, a tack must be made in that position.

[Illustration: A Schooner-of-War, getting under weigh.]

If riding by the starboard cable, and no impediment to port, it will
be the most eligible method, to cast her on the starboard tack, as the
cable will then be clear of the cutwater, and the ship being to leeward
of the anchor, it can be more easily catted and fished. If there should
be much sea on, this would be the best plan.

Having determined to cast on the starboard tack, overhaul the lifts,
trusses, and backstay-falls. The fore-topsail being put aback, by the
starboard braces; the main and mizen by the wind, with larboard after
braces, heaving around briskly, and before breaking ground, give her
a shear with the starboard helm; when up, hoist the jib, keeping the
helm a-starboard, until the stern-board exceeds the velocity of the
tide, when shift it, grapple the buoy, and cat the anchor. When she has
fallen off, so as to fill the after sails, let flow the jib-sheet, haul
out the spanker, set top-gallant sails and courses, and trim the yards
and sails properly.

To cast off on the larboard tack, put the helm a-port, and brace the
yards the contrary way.

=272.=--WHEN THE MESSENGER STRANDS, OR IS LIKELY TO PART.

If the messenger is likely to part, from the great strain upon it,
stopper immediately, and either pass a new one, or reeve a viol
purchase, assisting it with the cat-fall. Lash the viol block to
the cable near the hawse-hole; clinch one end of the hawser to the
main-mast, snatch the bite in the block, and take the other end to
the capstan. To assist the viol, pass a strap round the cable, close
down to the water, to which hook the cat-fall, and heave up on both
purchases.

If the messenger should strand, stopper immediately, cut it, and then
knot or splice it.

[Illustration]

=273.=--TO GET UNDER-WEIGH AND STAND BEFORE THE WIND.

[Illustration]

Make all preparations for getting under-weigh, heave-in, and make sail
as before. Lay the main and mizen topsails square aback; the fore one
sharp aback, according to the side it is intended to cast--heave-in,
cant her the right way with the helm before tripping, and as soon as
the velocity of the stern-board is greater than that of the tide, shift
the helm, grapple the buoy, run up the jib as soon as it will take, and
haul aft the weather-sheet. While falling off, cat and fish the anchor;
as she gathers head-way, shift the helm; when before the wind, right
it--square the head yards, and brail up the jib--set topgallant sails,
royals, and foresail--haul taut the lifts, trusses, backstay-falls, and
if necessary, set the studding-sails.

=274.=--IN GETTING UNDER-WEIGH, TO BACK ASTERN AND AVOID DANGER.

[Illustration]

Make all preparations as before. If required to cast on the starboard
tack, sheer her with the starboard helm; to bring the wind on the
starboard bow, brace the yards aback, about half-way up with the
larboard braces; haul out the spanker and keep the boom nearly
amid-ships. Heave up briskly, grapple the buoy, and as soon as the
anchor is up, put the helm hard a-weather to keep her to--cat and fish
the anchor. Having made sufficient stern-board, shift the helm, brace
the after yards, ease off the spanker sheet, and run up the jib. When
full aft, brace up the head yards, and as she gathers headway, right
the helm and make sail. To cast on the larboard tack, sheer her with
the port helm, brace all sharp aback, and proceed as before.

=275.=--GETTING UNDER-WEIGH--A SHOAL ON EACH BEAM.

It becomes necessary to proceed to sea, and is impossible to weather
either of those a-beam; but there is just room to pass between a shoal
astern, and either of those a-beam, with the wind _blowing fresh_.

Pass the stream cable out of one of the quarter ports; bend on one
end to the cable, and secure the other to the topsail sheet-bitts;
draw the splice[28] of the cable, bend a slip-buoy to it, and
heave it overboard. See the stoppers clear for slipping; stop the
topsails to the yards with spun-yarn, casting off the gaskets. Loose
the courses, jib, and spanker--mast-head the topsail-yards--man the
jib-halliards--sheer her from the cable with the helm--slip and run up
the jib--keep fast the stream-cable, and let her swing round. When she
heads for the passage, slip the stream-cable, right the helm, sheet
home the topsails, set the courses, and other sails if necessary; then
stand through the passage.

[28] If chain cable, unshackle.

=276.=--GETTING UNDER-WEIGH IN A NARROW CHANNEL.

[Illustration]

At anchor in a narrow channel, riding to a strong leeward tide, and
blowing fresh; a ship astern, and also one on each quarter, so near
that there is not room to wear, for casting; it is necessary to put to
sea, and to do so a passage must be effected between the two ships.

Make all preparations for getting under-weigh, and heave-in as
described before. Loose the topsails; if riding by the star-board
cable, give her a _rank sheer_ with the starboard helm; set up the
starboard backstays, and bear aft the larboard ones; overhaul lifts and
trusses; haul out the spanker, and get the boom over on the larboard
quarter; lead along the main tack and sheet; run up the jib, and haul
aft the weather sheet; “Heave round cheerily;” run the anchor up,
grapple the buoy, and as soon as she fills, meet her with the helm;
board the main tack to catch her; trim the jib and spanker sheets, set
the foresail, and trim sharp; haul taut the bowlines; stand on as far
as may be necessary.

_Note._--A good deal of uncertainty attends this manœuvre; if there
is room, it would be the best plan to lay the yards aback. It is
confidently asserted by old experienced seamen, that the above method
is perfectly practicable.

=277.=--HEAD TO WIND, CAST ON STARBOARD TACK.

[Illustration]

Everything having been previously prepared, heave in and make sail as
before. Sheer her with a starboard helm; brace the head yards sharp up
with the starboard braces, and counter brace the after ones; haul out
the spanker, and get the boom on the larboard quarter; heave in, and
up anchor; up jib as soon as it will take; and when the stern-board
exceeds the velocity of the tide, shift the helm. When the after sails
are full, trim the spanker, let flow the jib sheet, cat and fish the
anchor, haul aft the jib sheet, brace round the head-yards, and make
sail.

=278.=--WINDWARD TIDE--GET UNDER-WEIGH AND STAND BEFORE THE WIND.

Make all preparation for getting under-weigh, heave in, loose jib, up
anchor, grapple the buoy, run up the jib, cat and fish the anchor, and
make sail with expedition.

If it is necessary to have the ship under greater command, as might be
the case in a narrow channel, or crowded harbor, it would be better to
proceed as follows:--

Heave in to a “short stay,” loose the courses, topsails, jib and
spanker. If riding by the starboard cable, sheer her with the
starboard helm, and bring the wind on the larboard quarter; brace the
yards to, by the larboard braces, and keep them shivering by the helm.
“Heave up;” fill the after yards, and square the head ones; haul aft
jib sheet on starboard tack; cat and fish the anchor; up helm; fill the
head yards, shiver the after ones, get her before the wind, and make
sail.

=279.=--TO GET UNDER-WEIGH, AND STAND OUT ON A WIND.

[Illustration]

Make all preparations--commence heaving in; loose jib and spanker; top
up and bear over the boom on the right quarter, and the helm to the
side which it is intended to cast; “heave up;” get the buoy; haul out
on the spanker as soon as it will take. When the wind gets abeam, run
up the jib, and meet her with the helm; cat and fish the anchor; loose,
sheet home, and hoist the topsails, brace up, bring by and make sail.

=280.=--RIDING HEAD TO TIDE, WIND ON THE STARBOARD QUARTER, TO GET
UNDER-WEIGH ON THE STARBOARD TACK.

Make all preparations, heave short, loose sails, sheet home and hoist
the topsails, bracing them to with the starboard braces; keep them
_shivering_, by the assistance of the topsails and helm,--“heave
round,”--break ground--put the helm a-starboard--brace full the head
yards--run up the jib, and let her pay round to port; heave up the
anchor, and grapple the buoy. Haul out the spanker as soon as it will
take--shift over the head sheets, and square the head yards--trim aft
the jib-sheet, and meet her with the helm. Cat and fish the anchor, and
make sail as necessary.

=281.=--GETTING UNDER-WEIGH--WIND ACROSS THE TIDE.

In getting under-weigh, say ebb-tide, make all preparations, loose,
sheet home, and hoist the topsails; brace up the fore and mizen
topsails, and lay the main yard to the mast. Give her a spoke or two
of the lee wheel, so as to take the main-topsail well aback. “Heave
up,” cat and fish the anchor, and grapple the buoy; at the same time,
set the jib and spanker--fill the main yard, stand on to a convenient
place, and then tack or veer.

The evolution is determined by the circumstance of there being more
room to windward or to leeward.

_Flood-Tide._--Proceed as before, until the anchor is catted
and fished; then hoist the jib, haul out the spanker, fill the
main-topsail, and stand out, making whatever sail may be judged
necessary.

[Illustration]

=282.=--TO BACK AND FILL IN A TIDE-WAY.

[Illustration]

This manœuvre is only executed when a ship is to proceed up or down a
rapid river against the wind, which is supposed to be light, and may be
done by two methods, viz., driving before the wind, or broadside to it.
When the channel is broad enough, the latter method is preferable, as
the ship will be more under the command of her helm.

=283.=--DRIVING BEFORE THE WIND.

[Illustration]

This is only done in a very narrow channel. Heave up the anchor,
and get her before the wind, with just sail enough to keep her so.
Suppose her under topsails, and as she drops with the tide, it becomes
necessary for her to remain stationary, to allow a ship to pass her
stern,--set topgallant-sails, and if required to shoot ahead, drop
the foresail. If to avoid a rock, or ship astern, put the helm up or
down--haul out the spanker--brace up, and haul aft the jib-sheet, as
she comes to; shoot across until clear of danger, when put the helm up,
brail up the spanker, shiver the after yards, and when before the wind,
brail up the jib. If in standing across, she should get too near the
shore--get her on the other tack, by wearing or box-hauling.

=284.=--DRIVING BROADSIDE-TO.

Get under-weigh, and bring her by the wind under the jib, topsails, and
spanker; shiver the topsails; when filled, stand on to the middle of
the channel; brail up the jib and spanker, and let her _drift_ in this
situation until she falls off, which she will soon do, owing to her
greater immersion aft than forward, which will drift her stern farther
to windward. Haul out the spanker, and if this is insufficient, back
the mizen-topsail; if she still falls off, back the main also, both
square aback, and if she should get a stern-board, put the helm hard
a-weather; should she come-to again, shiver the topsails, and brail up
the spanker, letting her drift as before.

=285.=--SECURING THE SHIP FOR SEA.

Take the departure, give the course, and make sail. Beat to
quarters--examine the magazine--load, shot, and secure the guns--see
that all the gear of the guns is ready for service, and secured. Fill
the shot-boxes, rack, and wad-nets--get the anchors on the bows, and
lash them--unbend the cable and buoy-ropes; if clean and dry, pay
them below; also the messenger, hawsers, stoppers and nippers, and
cable-mats, put in the buckles--unreeve, cat and fish, and coil them
away below. Get chafing-mats on the yards and rigging--see the booms
and boats secured, pumps in good order, and the gratings and tarpaulins
ready for putting on. Overhaul the storm-staysail gear, see everything
ready for service, and stow it below again.

=286.=--STOWING THE ANCHORS FOR SEA.

The anchors being catted and fished, clap a stout tackle on them and
cat-head stoppers; pass a good lashing through the ring and over the
cat-head--expend the stopper in the same way. Hook the pendant-tackle
to a strap around the shank--weigh the crown, and bouse the fluke into
the bill-port by a thwartship tackle; having another tackle clapt on
the end of the anchor-stock which is uppermost, getting it as close
to the side as the stock will permit; pass stout shank-lashings also
around the stock and cat-head. _Unbend the cable and buoy-rope._

_Note._--The waist-anchors are securely stowed when they are first
got on board. Some ships use preventer lashings and jumpers in bad
weather, when the ship is lurching in a heavy sea, or when liable to
ship _seas_ in the waist.

=287.=--SETTING TOPGALLANT SAILS--BLOWING FRESH.

[Illustration]

Point the yards to the wind, and loose the sails; sheet home first to
leeward, and then to windward--having a hand to leeward to light the
foot over the topmast stay; hoist away, trim the yards, and haul taut
the bow-lines.

_Note._--In setting topgallant sails over single-reefed topsails, see
that the sheets are out square alike.

=288.=--SETTING COURSES.

[Illustration]

_Moderate weather._--Man the fore and main-tacks and sheets, attend
the rigging--have hands on the lower yards to overhaul it--haul
aboard--check the top bow-lines, weather lower lifts, and a little
of the lee-main-brace--avast the sheets; get the tacks close down,
and then haul aft the sheets--haul taut the main-brace, lifts,
trusses, and bowlines.

_Blowing fresh._--Man well the sheets, overhaul the leech-lines and
lee-bunt-lines; ease down the lee-clew-garnet, slack top bowlines,
lower lifts, and lee-main-braces, until the tacks are down; then
haul aft the sheets, haul taut the lee-main-brace, weather lifts and
bow-lines, and, if necessary, hook and haul taut the rolling-tackle,
to ease the trusses.

=289.=--SETTING THE SPANKER.

Top-up the boom, overhaul lee-topping-lifts, attend the sheets and
weather-guy; haul over the lee-guy, and trim the boom--man the outhaul
and attend the brails and vangs--let go the brails, haul out and steady
the gaff by the vangs.

_Note._--The weather-vang should never be hauled, or boused too taut,
as it may be the means of carrying away the gaff, especially when
using trysails as storm-sails.

=290.=--SETTING THE JIB.

[Illustration]

Cant the spritsail-yard to steady the boom; man the halliards and
sheet--see the downhaul and brails clear, take in the slack of the
sheet to steady the sail; “hoist away;” and as the sail goes up, ease
off the sheet--when taut up, haul aft the sheet.

=291.=--SETTING LOWER STUDDING-SAILS.

When the boom is out or a-thwartships, and trimmed with the fore yard,
the outer halliards and outhauler are to be well manned, taking in the
slack of the inner halliards, as the sail goes over the gunwale, and
ultimately reaches its destined height. In running away with the lower
halliards, care must be taken that the yard be not brought up with a
_jerk_, against the topmast studding-sail boom; by this sudden jerk
booms are liable to be sprung.

=292.=--SHIFTING A COURSE AT SEA.

_Moderate weather._--In shifting a course at sea, with the watch, and
with time to prepare everything for a smart and pretty evolution--get
the spare sail up from below, and first of all stretched across the
deck. Then, the course being set, stopper the (tack and sheet) clews,
and unbend tacks, sheets, clew-garnets, and leech-lines, bending them
forthwith to the spare sail; and, when done, untoggle the bowlines, and
send the hands aloft--trice up, lay out, cast off robins and earings,
and make the two midship robins fast to the bunt-lines--ease in the
earings together, and make them also fast to the buntlines a-midships.
Lower the sail by the bunt-lines, and gather it in by hand. Unbend the
bunt-lines, bend them to the spare sail, and take out the yard-ropes.

Divide the watch to the yard-ropes, bunt-lines and clew-garnets, and
haul taut; haul out and up all together--hands aloft, bring-to, and
when brought-to, haul on board.

_Blowing fresh._--First haul the sail up and furl it; then proceed
to make fast the midship robins and earings (when cast off) to the
bunt-lines, and to lower the sail down by the clew-garnets, as well
as buntlines.

_Note._--In this case the weather-tack and sheet is of much use in
hauling the sail in as it comes down.

[Illustration]

=293.=--TAKING IN A COURSE IN A GALE OF WIND.

Steady the yard as securely as possible, man the clew-garnets,
bunt-lines, and leech-lines; ease away the tack and bow-line--haul up
to windward, ease off the sheet, haul up, get the sail close to the
yard, and furl it.

It is a common practice in clewing-up a course, to _let go_ the bowline
upon starting the tack. Neither the tack nor the bow-line should be
let go, but each eased off handsomely by hand. By the adoption of this
plan, the sail will bag less to leeward, and the weather-clew can be
hauled up with greater ease; but both buntlines should be well manned,
and even _better manned_, than the weather clew-garnet. When the latter
gear is well up, walk away with the clew-garnet, easing steadily the
sheet. But all these precautions will be of little avail, unless there
be a good preventer-brace upon the lower yard; or else the yard tackle
be hooked to act as such, and brought sufficiently _aft_ to prevent the
tackle bringing too great a strain in an up-and-down position upon the
upper yard-arms.

=294.=--TAKING IN A TOPSAIL IN A GALE OF WIND.

Steady well the topsail and lower yards, rounding in the weather
topsail brace as much as possible. Man the clewlines and buntlines;
attend the sheets and bowlines; clew up the lee-sheet, and haul up the
buntline. If to save the yard, haul up to leeward first, point the yard
to the wind, and steady it again; lay out and furl the sail.

There appears to be still a dispute among seamen as to the preferable
method of effecting this service.

When the mast is not considered in danger, and the object be to save
the sail, or to ease the ship, the weather clew may be first lifted.
But before _starting_ the weather sheet, it would be well to ease first
a few feet of the _lee_-sheet, in order to lessen the labor of rounding
in the weather brace. So soon as the lee-sheet be sufficiently eased to
admit of the yard coming in with the weather brace, and both buntlines
be as well manned as the weather clewline, the weather sheet may be
then eased off, and the weather clewline hauled up, with every prospect
of saving the sail.

If there be plenty of sea room, and the ship can be kept away, some
officers recommend the practice of bringing the wind abaft the beam,
and then hauling up the _lee-clewline first_--taking the precaution
to have both buntlines well manned. When this operation is effected,
the weather clewline may be hauled up, rounding the brace in, as the
ship is again gradually brought to the wind. It will require particular
attention to the helm when hauling up the weather clewline, though with
judicious management, the helm alone is sufficient to _spill_ the sail.

=295.=--TAKING IN TOP-GALLANT SAILS.

Man the topgallant clewlines; lay aloft, and stand by to furl the
sail; attend the braces, bowlines, sheets, and halliards; round in the
weather braces, ease away the lee-sheet and halliards; “lower away;”
ease away the weather sheet, clew up, haul up the buntlines; steady the
yard, lay out and furl the sail.

=296.=--TAKING IN A SPANKER.

Have the brails and weather vang well manned; attend the outhaul and
lee vang; ease away the outhaul; haul over on the weather vang; brail
up to leeward; ease off the sheet; haul taut the weather brails; pass
the foot gaskets; steady the gaff, and crutch the boom.

=297.=--SETTING A CLOSE-REEFED TOPSAIL.

Point the yard to the wind, and brace the lower yard a little _sharper_
than the topsail yard. Man the sheets, attend the buntlines, and loose
the sail; overhaul the lee-buntline, ease down the lee-clewlines, and
haul home the lee-sheet; ease off the weather buntline; at the same
time slack down the weather clewline, and haul home the weather sheet.
Hoist the yard up clear of the cap; brace up, and haul the bowline;
steady the lower and topsail yards with the braces and rolling-tackles.

_Note._--It must be remembered that a close reefed topsail will not
sheet close home, as the yard is to hoist clear of the cap.

=298.=--A CLOSE-REEFED TOPSAIL SPLITS.

Clew up the sail and steady the yard; cast off some of the rope-bands,
so as to pass stops around the sail to secure it. Unbend the sheets,
bowlines, and lee-buntlines; unreeve lee-clewline and reef-tackle;
bend the weather buntline round the sail, and make the lee-earing fast
to the buntline; hook a burton to a strap round the sail, cast off
all the rope-bands, and lower away; ease away the weather earing and
lower the sail on deck. Stretch along the new sail, overhaul it, then
reef the sail at the foot, commencing at the close reef, and taking
in each of the three lower reefs separately; then bight it down, and
send it aloft, as described before, observing to use the burtons before
all. Reeve and bend the gear, stopping the head of the sail to the
buntlines; have yard-jiggers hooked to bring the sail to the yard--pass
the earings and rope-bands, in the same manner; bring the first reef
to the yard, cast out the other reef, haul up the sail; then bring the
reefs to the yard alternately, after which set the sail as before.

=299.=--A JIB SPLITS.

Mind the weather helm, haul the sail down, and hoist the
fore-topmast-staysail. Hitch the downhaul around the body of the
sail, and also pass stops around it--take the end of a rope from the
forecastle, and bend it on to haul in by. Turn out the jib-stays, bend
a line on to the end and unreeve it--haul taut the halliards--ease off
the downhaul, and haul in. Get up, and overhaul the spare sails; seize
on the sheet, bend the halliards and downhaul--stop the sail, and haul
out by the downhaul and halliards--reeve the jib-stay, turn it in, and
set it up; pass the tack-lashings, reeve the brails, set the jib, and
haul down the staysail.

=300.=--TO WEAR SHIP UNDER CLOSE-REEFED MAIN-TOPSAIL AND
STORM-STAYSAILS.

Call all hands “wear ship,” and station them; have lifts, trusses, and
rolling-tackles attended, so the yard and topmast may be well supported
in the heavy rolling which they are likely to experience. Haul down
the mizen storm-staysail, and when she falls off, up helm; ease off
the main storm-staysail sheet, and brace in the main and cross-jack
yards; at the same time taking care to keep the maintopsail full, to
preserve the head-way, and to keep her a-head of the sea; also to keep
it from splitting. When the wind is on the quarter, haul down the main
storm-staysail, and shift over the sheet; when before the wind, right
the helm, and square the head yards; shift over the fore storm-staysail
sheet; watch for a smooth time to bring-her-to; then ease down the
helm, hoist the mizen storm-staysail, and when the wind is on the
quarter, brace up the yards, hoist the main storm-staysail, haul aft
the fore storm-staysail sheet, meet her with the helm, trim the sails,
and haul the maintop-bowline.

=301.=--WEARING UNDER A MAINSAIL.

Make fast a hawser to the slings of the main yard, take it down
forward of the sail, haul it well taut, and belay it to the topsail
sheet bitts. Call all hands and station them as in the last case; take
advantage of her falling off to put the helm up. Ease off the main
sheet, and gather in the lee tack, using the yards as in ordinary
cases. Should she not go off, send down the cross-jack yard, and
mizentopsail yard; house the topmast, and get a drag over the lee
quarter, after which proceed as before in bracing the yards, and bring
by the wind.

=302.=--WEARING UNDER BARE POLES.

Send down the after yards and mizen topmast, and bend a hawser to it
in-board. Send men in the weather fore rigging with tarpaulins; up
helm, and make use of the yards as usual.

If she should not go off, it will be necessary, as a last resort,
to cut away the mizen mast, veer away the hawser, and use the mizen
topmast as a drag to assist in wearing.

=303.=--CUTTING AWAY THE MASTS.

Clear away all the running rigging attached to the mast, cut away the
lanyards of the lee rigging; then the lanyards of the stays and weather
rigging.

=304.=--LAYING-TO UNDER LOWER STAYSAILS, WEAR SHIP.

If it does not blow too fresh, the close-reefed mainsail may be set, as
some lofty sail is necessary, to prevent the ship from being pooped;
then proceed as in veering under bare poles. If she should not go off,
clap a lashing round the bunt of the foresail, and set the weather
goose-wing. Should she still not go off, send down the after yards and
mizen topmast, making a drag of them. If they have no effect, cut away
the mizen mast.

[Illustration: Scale-draft of a First Class Ship-of-the-Line, two
decks.]

PART V.

=305.=--PRECAUTIONS FOR SCUDDING.

When scudding in a heavy gale of wind, care should be taken that
sufficient of lofty sail be carried on the vessel, to keep her freely
and fairly _before_ the sea. A ship will scud better with the sea right
aft, than quartering. With a heavy sea, the danger to be apprehended
is, that the wave traveling faster than the ship, may overtake and
break over her. To avoid this, and diminish its danger, some such
sail as a close-reefed topsail or foresail is generally kept set
as long as possible; but there are times when the foresail is not
the best suited, nor the safest for scudding. Some ships that steer
badly, and manifest an inclination to _yaw_, will be more steadily
steered, and easier managed when scudding under the fore-topsail and
fore-staysail. Should the ship happen to broach-to, the foresail, in
such a perilous situation, is an unwieldy and unmanageable sail to clew
up; and when the sea strikes the ship on the quarter, and causes her
head to round-to in the direction of the wind, the main-topsail tends
to assist the sea in producing this dangerous movement; whereas, the
fore-staysail, together with the fore-topsail, produces the contrary
effect.

It is deeply laden ships that are most liable to get pooped; in which
circumstance, a skilful foresight must be exercised in lightening them.

Relieving-tackles should be hooked, and hands stationed to attend them;
spare tiller and rudder-chocks at hand, and perfectly ready for use;
for, if the ship should get pooped with a heavy sea, the tiller is
likely to get snapped, the ship to broach-to, and the rudder, if not
quickly secured, to be _unhung_, and after damaging the stern, to be
lost. Wreck then almost immediately follows.

When using the foresail, a tackle hooked to the lee fore-tack would be
of service in filling the sail.

=306.=--SCUDDING.--A SHIP BROACHES-TO.

Meet her with the helm, and lee head braces, if necessary; shiver the
after yards; should she still come-to, and the sails are taken aback,
brace about the head yards, and if necessary, use the helm. If she
should get too much stern-board in falling off, haul up the foresail,
and pay her off with the fore storm-staysail; fill the after yards
as soon as possible, to gather headway, and when she has fallen off
sufficiently, brace about the head yards, and trim as before.

_Note._--As in scudding, the safety of the ship depends entirely
upon the steering, the greatest care should be taken that a steady
and expert helmsman is stationed at the wheel, and that when his
“trick” is out, and his “relief” arrives to take his place, that he
resigns not his hand at the helm, until his successor is in full
possession of the easiest method of steering the ship. The officer of
the deck should also direct a compass to be placed in the gun-room,
and be cautious that a competent seaman is there to attend the
relieving tackles, and watch closely the steerage of the ship by the
compass-card.

In frigates, and particularly flushed-decked vessels, whose
binnacle-lights are liable to be extinguished by the wind, precaution
should be taken that lighted lanterns are kept in readiness to supply
the place of the blown-out lights. On dark and starless nights, when
the steersman has no other guide to govern his steerage than the
compass-card, it is of the utmost importance that attention should
be paid to this particular; as in a number of instances the accident
of _broaching-to_ may be traced to the “blowing out” of the binnacle
lights, and carelessness of the helmsman. It requires a quick, small
_helm_ to steer a ship when scudding.

=307.=--SCUDDING.--BROUGHT BY THE LEE.

A ship is said to be “brought by the lee” when struck aback by a
change of wind. If she has headway, which will probably be the case,
put the helm a-weather, but if she has sternway, the contrary. Brace
round the after yards, and when they are full, the head ones. This is
the principle of tacking, but it is not thought as well when scudding
in a gale, as the ship might get too rapid sternway, which would be
dangerous in a heavy sea. As the object is to preserve the headway,
the yards are braced round as soon as possible. If scudding under the
main-topsail, and it becomes necessary to reduce sail, take in the
fore-topsail, for the main being nearer the centre of gravity, has
less tendency to bury the ship, and she is consequently more easily
steered.

When scudding under the main-topsail and foresail, the ship is to be
brought by the wind, and she should have a tendency to gripe, keep the
foresail on her; but if otherwise, take in the foresail, and set the
fore storm-staysail; brace up the head yards, then the after ones.
Watch for a smooth time, and ease down the helm, taking care to meet
her in due time.

The reason for bracing up the head yards before luffing, is, in
scudding the ship has a rapid headway, and will mind the helm very
quickly; moreover, the sea acting with violence on the quarter, will
throw her up into the wind, and unless the head yards are braced up so
as to prevent that, she will be in the same situation as if she had
broached-to.

=308.=--HEAVING-TO.

Having determined from the known quality of the ship, what sail would
be best to heave-to under; bring by the wind as in the previous
subject. If intending to lay-to under a main-topsail, when by the wind,
haul up and furl the foresail, down foretopmast-staysail; if under
lower-staysails, hoist them; at the same time taking in the foresail
and main-topsail.

The helm is kept a-lee while laying-to, but not lashed down, it being
considered best to have a little steerage-way on.

_Note._--It is best to bring by the wind under the square-sails, as
the ship is more under command than she would be if they were furled.

=309.=--TAKING IN A LOWER STUDDING-SAIL--BLOWING FRESH.

This is a much nicer operation than young officers generally are
inclined to admit, and unless executed with caution and skill on the
part of the officer “carrying on the duty” on deck, the probability
is, the topmast studding-sail boom will _snap_ short in the iron, and
the sail, swinging-boom gear and all, will have to be recorded in the
log as “expended.” When not sailing in a squadron, and the _yawing_ of
the ship be a matter of minor importance, the officer of the watch is
recommended to proceed as follows:--

Place a steady helmsman at the wheel, and stand close to him; man
well the sheet, and lead it well aft along the deck; also see that
steady hands attend the tack and guys. When perfectly prepared, direct
the helmsman with a “small helm,” to bring the wind gradually on the
opposite quarter, and the moment the body of the sail begins to lose
the breeze, and the canvass inclines to shiver, _lower_ the outer
halliards, ease the tack, and haul in on the sheet as rapidly as
possible, lowering the inner halliards at the same time.

_Note._--More booms are sprung, and even snapped short in the iron,
from the sudden jerk produced by lowering the lower halliards,
when the sail is straining and bellying to the breeze, than by
even carrying a powerful press of canvass. And here it may be well
to impress upon the mind of the young seaman, that a judicious
management of the helm, in almost every situation in which it can be
placed, will not only aid the physical strength employed, but also
greatly facilitate the service sought.

=310.=--TO UNBEND A TOPSAIL IN A GALE OF WIND.

Those who know the value of _minutes_ to men perched aloft in a
perilous position, will adopt that method which will eventually cost
the least time and trouble. The sail should be _first_ furled, then
detached from the yard, and sent down on deck (slung amidships) by the
long tackle[29] hooked at the topmast-head, and steadied forward clear
of the top-rim by the weather or lee bowline, according to the side on
which the sail is to be sent down. (See 298).

Should the ship be rolling or pitching to any extent, and it is not
deemed prudent to lower the furled sail “before all,” the sail may be
sent down through lubber’s hole. This method will depend entirely upon
the motion of the ship.

[29] Generally called the top-burton.

=311.=--SECURING IN A GALE.

See that the yards which have sails set upon them are not unnecessarily
sharp up; that the yards whose sails are furled are hoisted clear
of the caps; that the runners and tackles are up in good time; that
all unnecessary strain is taken off the rigging; and that mats are
carefully placed wherever a chafe is likely to occur, such as at the
bunts of the furled sails, and at the lee quarters of the yards, which
are braced up against the rigging.

See also that the fore and main sheets, if set, be checked a little;
the weather lifts and trusses well up and taut; jiggers on topsail
lifts, and studding-sails out of the rigging; anchors and guns properly
secured; and in a small vessel, the hatches battened down, extra on
boats, spare spars, &c., &c.

=312.=--PREPARATIONS FOR A HURRICANE AT SEA.

Endeavor to get sea room; if you have it, run before the wind. The
captain and first officer to cunn the ship; two or three of the best
men to steer; the master to keep the time, and the courses steered, and
have the ship’s place kept worked up.

Previous to its coming on, have a life-line set up on each side of
the deck. Furl all sails, and secure them with studding-sail tacks
as well as long gaskets; batten down the hatches, and have the
relieving tackles on the tiller; down topgallant-yards, and send
topgallant-masts on deck, and flying jib-boom in. Clear the tops; gaffs
down; rudder-chocks and spare tiller at hand; axes and hawsers at hand;
scuppers clear; pumps ready. Let each man wear a belt to secure himself
if required to the most convenient place; keep the after yards square;
head yards thrown forward, and have the fore-staysail set with double
sheets.

=313.=--PREPARATIONS FOR A HURRICANE AT AN ANCHOR, (_with notes on the
Barometer._)

The ship should be moored with a whole cable each way if in harbor, or
if in an open roadstead, veer to a hundred fathoms on each anchor.

The more your berth is out of the way of other ships, the better, as
vessels driving, or getting adrift, occasion much damage to those who
might otherwise have held on.

If moored, the sheet cable to be bent and ranged, and the anchor let
go, and veer on the bowers to the clinches.

All the ground tackle you have should be used. Have a _shackle_ abaft
the foremost stopper, on each cable, ready for slipping if absolutely
necessary, to prevent swamping, or from other causes.

Batter down fore and aft.

Down topgallant yards and masts.

If time, unbend sails (topsails and courses, I mean).

Strike lower-yards and topmasts.

Get yards as much fore and aft as possible.

Jib-boom eased in.

Keep try-sails and fore stay-sail bent, and the former reefed. Unreeve
the running rigging, that nothing may be aloft to hold the wind.

Clear the tops.

No boats to be above the gunwale.

Axes and hawsers up ready.

If anchors drag, cut away lower masts--the rigging being first cut
and cleared. Remember the stays.

_Notes and remarks on the Barometer._

==============================+======================================
|As the force of the wind is what is
|required for service at sea, the
SCALE OF BAROMETER AT PRESENT.|following would be better understood.
------------------------------+-------+------------------------------
Inches.| |Inches.|
31.0 |Very dry. | |
30.5 |Set fair. | 30.5 |Very settled.
30.0 |Fair. | 30.0 |Fine weather.
| | 29.7 |Unsettled.
29.5 |Changeable. | 29.5 |Gale.
| | 29.2 |Storm.
29.0 |Rain. | 29.0 |Violent storm.
28.5 |Much rain. | 28.5 |Tempest.
28.0 |Stormy. | |

When the mercury _falls_ in the Barometer, it announces rain, or
wind, or in general what is called bad weather; and, on the contrary,
when it _rises_, it announces fair weather.

When the mercury falls in frosty weather, either snow, or a thaw may
be expected; but if it rises in the winter with a north or east wind,
it generally forebodes a frost.

If the mercury sinks slowly, we may expect rain, which will probably
be of some continuance; but if it rises gradually, we may expect fine
weather that will be lasting.

When the Barometer is fluctuating, rising and falling suddenly, the
weather may be expected to be like it--changeable.

When the mercury falls very low, there will be much rain; but if its
fall is low and sudden, a high wind frequently follows.

When an extraordinary fall of the mercury happens, without any
remarkable change near at hand, there is some probability of a storm
at a distance.

In very warm weather the fall of the mercury indicates thunder.

The Barometer will descend sometimes as an indication of wind only,
and sometimes rise when the wind is to the north or east.

A north-east wind generally causes the Barometer to rise, and it is
generally low with a south-west wind.

An extraordinary fall of the mercury will sometimes take place in
summer previous to heavy showers, attended with thunder; but in
spring, autumn, and winter, it indicates violent winds.

The mercury is higher in cold than in warm weather, and lower at noon
and midnight than at any other period of the day.

The mercury generally falls at the approach of new and full moon, and
rises at the quadratures.

Before high tides, there is almost always a great fall of the
mercury; this takes place oftener at the full than at the new moon.

The greatest changes of the Barometer commonly take place during
clear weather with a north wind, and the smallest risings during
cloudy, rainy, or windy weather, with a south or nearly south wind.

The words generally engraved on the plate of the Barometer, rather
serve to _mislead_, than to inform; for the changes of weather depend
rather on the rising and falling of the mercury, than on its standing
at any particular height.

When the mercury is as high as “fair,” and the surface of it is
_concave_, (which is the case when it begins to descend,) it very
often rains; and on the contrary, when the mercury is opposite
“rain,” and the surface of it is _convex_, (which is the case when it
begins to ascend,) fair weather may be expected. These circumstances
not being duly attended to, is the principal cause that many people
have not a proper confidence in this instrument.

For sea-service, it would be as well to read the Barometer off three
times a day at least--at 8 A. M., noon, and 8 P. M.--and oftener if
bad weather.

In Europe, if the alteration in the quicksilver should be in as great
a proportion as six-tenths of an inch to twenty-four hours, sudden
but not lasting changes of weather may be expected.

If the alteration should be gradual, probably in the proportion of
two or three-tenths to twenty-four hours, the weather indicated will
be likely to last.

One-fifth of the variation of the Barometer, in any climate, in
twenty-four hours, may be considered as an indication of sudden
change.

If wind should follow rain, the wind may be expected to increase.

Rain following wind is likely to lull it, and the wind may be
expected to abate.

=314.=--THE FOREMAST IS CARRIED AWAY.

Hard up the helm, brace in the after yards, hoist the main-staysail,
take in after sail, and endeavor to get before the wind; if successful,
keep her so, by veering a range of cable over the stern, and lashing
it amidships; if not, which is most likely to be the case, and should
carry away the main-topmast also, lay her to under the main-staysail.
If the main-topmast should stand, clew-up the main-topsail immediately,
get the breast backstays over the topsail-yard, and set them up as far
forward as possible, by means of tackles. Bend hawsers on the wreck,
clear it away, _especially the lanyards of the lee-rigging_, so as to
preserve the channels and chain-bolts, and endeavor to haul it aboard.
Send down the after yards and spars, and save as much of the wreck as
possible. Rig a jury-foremast, fitting spars and sails to the best
advantage; when the jury-mast is rigged, reeve a main-topmast stay,
of a hawser, and take the breast-backstays aft again, after which cut
clear of the wreck, if not required.

=315.=--TO RIG A JURY-MAST.

Take a spare spar, the largest on board, a main-topmast for instance,
and launch the head over the night-heads, the heel resting against the
stump of the old mast; put on the cross-trees and bolsters, fit the
rigging and stays from hawsers, and hook a couple of tackles from the
jury-mast head--which take to the sides and haul taut; hook another,
which take well aft; lash the heel of the stump to prevent slipping,
and raise the mast with the after purchase, tending the stays and
pendant-tackles; when up, reeve the lanyards, set up the rigging and
stays. Cleet and lash the heel securely. Ship the cap, send up a
topgallant-mast for a topmast, fit a topsail yard for a lower yard, and
a topgallant yard for a topsail yard, and so on.

=316.=--ACCIDENTS TO TILLER.

_In the event of losing a mast._

Should the tiller break in the rudder head, the rudder must immediately
be chocked, that its stump may be taken out and the spare tiller
fitted, which, together with the chock, should _always_ be placed in
readiness for immediate use. While the rudder is useless, the ship must
be hove-to till it is repaired, or some contrivance prepared to supply
its place.

=317.=--THE MAIN-MAST IS CARRIED AWAY.

Hard-up the helm, secure the mizen topmast if it still stands, clear
the wreck, save as much as possible, and rig a jury main-mast, as above.

=318.=--THE BOWSPRIT IS CARRIED AWAY.

Hard-up the helm, shiver the after yards, take in after sail, and
get the ship before the wind; take the fore-topmast breast-backstays
forward over the top-sail yard, hook the pendant tackles and set them
up to the cat-heads; unreeve the main-topmast and spring-stays, and
set them up to the foretopsail sheet bitts; hitch a hawser to the
foretopmast head, take this in through one of the hawse-holes, and
set it up on the gun-deck. While this is performing, let some hands
be reducing sail, sending down topgallant yards and masts if they
are aloft, and clearing the wreck; rig a jury-bowsprit of a spare
main-topmast or a jib-boom.

=319.=--A TOPMAST IS CARRIED AWAY.

Get the ship before the wind immediately, and reduce sail; hook the
top-blocks and reeve hawsers through them; bend the lee one to the
topsail-yard, which is probably hanging to leeward of the topmast, with
the wreck. Clew up the topsail if practicable, and cut the parrel if
it can be got at. The yard now hangs clear of the topmast; bend the
weather hawser to the wreck of the topmast; have guys from the weather
side of the deck--clear away the lanyards of the rigging and stays,
also the rigging leading to the topmast head, and send it down on deck;
hook the yard-tackles, slack the braces and trusses, bouse the lower
yards forward, and send down the stump; get the topsail-yard down in
the lee-gangway, and repair its damages while the spare topmast is got
aloft and secured by the old rigging; send aloft the yard, set the
topsails, and bring her to her course again.

=320.=--THE JIB-BOOM IS CARRIED AWAY.

Mind the weather helm, hoist the foretopmast-staysail, and get in the
wreck by the fore pendant-tackles, hooked to the fore-stay; reeve a
heel-rope and get in the stump; point another boom, and rig it with the
old rigging, if sound, if not, with spare ropes or hawsers.

=321.=--THE FOREMAST IS SPRUNG NEAR THE HOUNDS OR BIBBS.

Get the ship before the wind immediately, reduce sail, and get all the
strain off the foremast; secure the main-topmast.

Send down topgallant yards and masts; hook the jeers, and settle the
fore yard; hook top-blocks, reeve top-pendants and house topmasts,
allowing the heel to come considerably below the defect; fish the
foremast with side fishes, and the heel of the topmast, wedging the
lashings. Clap a lashing around the doublings of the mast-head, having
chocks between; keep the pendant-tackles rove, turn in the rigging
afresh, and set it up; wedge the topmast in the cap, and sway the
fore yard close up to the heel of the topmast; reef the head sails to
diminish the strain if required.

=322.=--THE FOREMAST AND BOWSPRIT CARRIED AWAY.

Proceed as in 314, the remarks being applied to the present case;
lay-to under the main-staysail, to leeward of the wreck, and repair
damages on board, in the best possible manner; rig a jury foremast and
bowsprit, and then cut clear, having saved as many spars and sails,
and as much rigging as possible; if the ship lays easily by the wreck,
it would probably be well to ride by it, until the gale abates. If it
is absolutely necessary to veer, it might be done as before mentioned,
with the assistance of the mainsail, making use of the wreck as a drag,
by taking the hawser as a spring to the quarter.

=323.=--THE BOWSPRIT IS SPRUNG.

Up helm, shiver the after yards, take in after sail, and get the ship
before the wind; haul down the head sails, come up the main topmast
stays, and set them up on deck; get the fore-topmast breast-backstays
forward, hook the fore pendant tackles, and set them up to the
cat-head; come up all the head stays, and rig in the head booms; send
down upper yards and masts, take the fore-topmast stays through the
hawse-hole, and set them up.

_Note._--All strain now being off the bowsprit, fish it with the
regular fishes; if there are none on board, use the jib-boom; if
thought sufficiently strong to bear the strain of the head stays, get
them in their proper places, but if not, get stays out merely to make
sail.

=324.=--A TOPMAST IS SPRUNG NEAR THE LOWER CAP.

Get the ship before the wind and reduce sail; if a spare topmast is not
to be had, the old one may be housed far enough to allow the spring to
come some feet below the cap, setting the lower yard as in the last
case; fit a larger chock between the topmast and lowermast head, and
clap stout lashings around, above, and below the defect part, wedging
them well; reef the foresail so that it can be set with the yard in its
present place, and also the top-sail, to lessen the strain on the weak
spar.

_Note._--Sheep-shank the rigging, if required, before setting up.

=325.=--TO SEND ALOFT A TOPMAST, AND A HEAVY SEA ON.

After the topmast is pointed and rigged, hook the burtons to stout
strops, at the rim of the top on each side; hitch hawsers to the
mast-head, leading one through a larger block at the fore-topmast head,
and another aft through one at the mizen; haul the burtons and hawsers
taut; sway aloft the topmast, slacking up as it goes aloft; when
fidded, steady the topmast until the rigging and stays are set up.

=326.=--THE GAMMONING CARRIED AWAY.

Proceed as in 323, until all strain is off the bowsprit; put a stout
chock on the bowsprit, and pass the end of the messenger out of a
hawse-hole, over the chock, in through the other hawse-hole, and bitt
it; take the other end to the capstan, and get the bowsprit well down
in its bed by the messenger and bob-stays; come up the old gammoning,
and pass a new one.

_Note._--Iron gammonings are used for all vessels, by new regulation.
(_See Rigging Table._)

=327.=--A LOWER CAP SPLITS.

Take all sail off the mast, pass a stout lashing around the topmast and
lower mast-head, which wedge; after which woold and wedge the cap.

=328.=--THE TRESTLE-TREES ARE SPRUNG.

Get the ship before the wind, take all sail off the mast, send down
topgallant yards and masts, housing the others; hook the top-blocks,
reeve top-pendants, hook top-tackles, and bouse them well taut, taking
all strain off the fid; pass several stout lashings around the heel
of the topmast and lower mast-head, cleating them to prevent their
slipping; make sail as the mast will bear.

=329.=--A LOWER YARD IS CARRIED AWAY IN THE SLINGS.

If the fore-yard, get the ship before the wind, haul up the foresail,
clew up the topsail, take in all sail on the mizen-mast, unreeve the
foretopsail sheets and board them on deck; bring her on your course
again, and haul the bowlines.

If a main-yard, keep on the course, haul up the mainsail, clew up the
topsail, unreeve the sheets, board them on deck, and haul the bowlines
well out; having proceeded thus far, get stout strops around the inner
quarter of the yard, and hook the pendant-tackles to bolts in the lower
cap, and these strops; if the pendant-tackles are not at hand, use the
burtons.

Lash the jear-blocks, reeve the jears, and send the yard down by the
jears, lifts, and pendant-tackles; fish the lower yards immediately, if
it can be done; if it cannot, rig a topsail yard for a lower yard.

=330.=--A TOPSAIL YARD IS CARRIED AWAY.

If it is the fore, reduce after sail; mind the weather helm, and keep
the ship on her course. If it is the main, stand on, clew up the sail,
unbend it, and get it into the top the best manner possible. Get a
strop around the topmast-head, above the eyes of the rigging, to which
hook a large single block, and reeve a hawser through it. If the yard
is completely broken off, bend the hawser which is not secured by the
parrel, bend on guys, and send it down; then send down the other piece.
If it still remains together, bend on the slings, stop out to leeward,
have a tripping line and rolling ropes, and get it fore and aft on
deck; take off all the old rigging, which put on to the spare yard in
the chains; then bend on the hawser, sway aloft, and cross it as in
fitting the ship out, have rolling ropes around it as it goes aloft;
bend the topsail, and set it.

=331.=--THE SHIP LEAKS FASTER THAN THE PUMPS CAN FREE HER.

Find out where the leak is; thrum an old sail very thickly, and have
stout ropes attached to each leech; make it up, take it under the
bowsprit, and get the ropes on their respective sides; heave the ship
to; when her headway eases, drop the sail overboard; after it has sunk
beneath the keel, break the stops, haul aft on the ropes attached to
each clew; when the body of the sail is over the leak, haul well taut
all the ropes attached to the leeches and the head, which will prevent
the sail from going aft when going ahead; make sail, and continue
pumping.

=332.=--THE PUMPS ARE CHOKED.

Hoist them out, and clear them.

=333.=--A SHOT GETS LOOSE IN A GUN SECURED FOR A GALE.

[Illustration]

Prick the cartridge well down, and pour vinegar enough in the
touch-hole to drown it.

=334.=--TO THROW A LOWER DECK GUN OVERBOARD.

Fit a chock in the port-sill, and over the pomelion of the gun,
to which, from the housing-bolt, hook a stout tackle; unlash the
muzzle, heave up the breech, and put in the bed and coin; unreeve the
breeching, throw back the cap squares, and place capstan bars under
the breech to ease it, and prevent the gun from slipping back into the
carriage again; man the side and port tackles, watch the roll, trice up
the port briskly, run out, and throw the gun clear of the carriage, by
the breech-tackles and capstan-bars; shut in the port immediately.

[Illustration]

[Illustration: United States’ Sloop-of-War Albany, under full sail.]

PART VI.

=335.=--TO TURN REEFS OUT OF THE TOPSAILS AND COURSES.

Haul taut the reef-pendants, and set taut the lower lifts; ease off the
bowlines; ease a little of the tacks and sheets of the courses, and
settle a few feet of the topsail halliards; haul taut the reef tackles
and buntlines, round in a little of the weather braces, to clear the
points of the lee-rigging; commence casting off the points of the bunt,
taking care to leave none tied, and turning one reef out at a time;
ease away both earings together; overhaul the rigging, get the tacks on
board; sheet home, hoist the topsails up to a taut leech, out bowlines
and make sail.

=336.=--THE RUDDER IS CARRIED AWAY--TO FIT ANOTHER.

Man the braces immediately; take in after sails, and let the ship run
a little free; rouse up a cable, clove-hitch a hawser over the cable,
and then pay it overboard; veer away about twenty fathoms, and lash it
amidships on the taffrail; lead the ends of the hawsers through large
blocks, lashed to the quarters, and clap tackles on them; steer the
ship by this contrivance, until a rudder can be constructed. (_See
Plate._)

Take a spare topmast, cut it the length of the rudder, enlarge the
fid-hole to receive the tiller, if not already large enough; take a
spare cap and cut away the after part, so as to fit the stern post
at the waters’ edge, or a little below; pass the topmast through the
round hole in the cap; take a spare jib-boom and cut it in two; the
pieces are to be bolted on abaft the topmast, after squaring the edges
which will come in contact with each other, and cutting a score in the
forward part of the jib-boom, next to the topmast, to allow the cap
to have room to play in; plank the whole over with stout oak plank,
and bolt in a fish abaft all; drive an eye-bolt into the heel of the
topmast (now the head of the rudder), and have kentledge attached to
the other end to sink it; take an anchor-stock and square two of the
edges; cut away a circular score in each, for them to join together
around the top mast, below the squares, and thus serve as an upper
gudgeon; drive the anchor-stock hoops on the rudder-head, to prevent
splitting.

Place the rudder on a stage, near the taffrail; pass a couple of
hawsers aft through the hawse-holes, and secure them to the heel of
the rudder; have tackles on their inner ends; have two more hawsers
or parts of hawsers passed from forward aft, under everything, one
each side, and clinch them to the quarter eye-bolts in the cap; have a
pendant round as described in another place; launch overboard and rouse
up on the head rope; heave in upon the hawsers, and bring the rudder to
the stern post, perpendicularly; secure the cap to the stern post and
the anchor-stock, around the rudder head; ship the tiller, reeve the
wheel-ropes, and rouse in the cable. The kentledge may remain to keep
the rudder perpendicular, or may be taken off, as the case may require.

_Note._--See improved sketch or plan of temporary rudder.

=337.=--A SHIP ON FIRE AT SEA.

Hard up the helm, haul up the courses, up spanker, get the ship before
the wind, and reduce sail to topsails; beat to quarters, close all the
ports, muster the men at their stations, call away the firemen, under
charge of their proper officers; let a part fill the engine and wet the
sails, while the other part finds out where the fire is, and endeavor
to extinguish it if possible--for which purpose use bedding; putting
over the gratings and tarpaulins. The gunner and his mates should be in
the magazine, ready to drown the powder at a moment’s notice; let the
carpenters rig and fetch the pumps, and the spar-deck division clear
away the boats, equip them, and get them ready for hoisting out; in the
above case, the fire is supposed to be below, and the helm is put up,
because wind is less felt; the ports are shut in, and the tarpaulins
put on, as they would afford air to the fire; and the courses hauled
up, because they strike a current of air down the hatchways, and are
also liable to catch. If the fire is on deck, and forward, keep before
the wind; if aft, haul close on a wind.

=338.=--A SHIP ON HER BEAM ENDS.

When the severity of the squall is felt, hard up the helm and let fly
everything; but if she goes on her beam ends before she can be got off
sufficiently to diminish the effects of the wind, the best way will be
to cut away the mizen-mast before the headway ceases, which falling
over the lee quarter, will act as a drag, to pay her off; should she
not right when before the wind, if there be an anchorage, and the cable
is bent, get the drag to the lee-bow, by means of a spring, and rouse
in; the wind acting on the flat deck, and under side of the sails,
will probably right her. As a last resort, cut away the masts--great
decision and rapidity of execution is necessary, as the ship must go
down a short time after she goes over.

=339.=--WIND FREE, ALL SAIL SET, STRUCK BY A SQUALL.

Up helm, let fly the main-sheets, spanker-outhaul, staysail-sheets
and halliards, royal and topgallant studding-sail-halliards, royal
and topgallant-sheets, and halliards; haul up the mainsail, brail
up the spanker, down staysails, and order the topmen to haul in the
studding-sails and stow them. When before the wind, right the helm,
clew down the topsails, haul up the buntlines, and out reef-tackles,
and reef if necessary; clear up the decks as fast as possible.

_Note._--In ordinary cases, sheets and tacks should be eased off, for
if they should get foul when running through their blocks fast, spars
might be endangered; but when struck by a severe squall, the effect
of the sails must be diminished as soon as possible, to save the
masts, and prevent her from going over.

=340.=--STRUCK BY A SQUALL ON A LEE SHORE.

If sail cannot be reduced, luff-too and shake her; fill away again,
gather headway, and luff again.

=341.=--STRUCK BY A SQUALL UNDER WHOLE TOPSAILS AND COURSERS.

Up helm, let fly the topsail halliards, main-sheet, spanker outhaul,
and lee-topsail sheets; haul up the mainsail, brail up the spanker,
clew up the topsails to leeward, then to windward; right the helm, and
reef if necessary.

=342.=--ON A WIND, UNDER WHOLE TOPSAILS--PART THE WEATHER MAIN-TOPSAIL
BRACE.

Haul up the mainsail, let go the lee main-brace, haul forward on the
lee-maintop-bowline, and aft on the weather main-brace; luff-too, and
when the main-topsail shivers, clew it down, haul up the buntlines, out
reef tackles, and steady the yard by the bowline, until a new brace can
be rove; a burton might be hooked to steady the yard.

=343.=--THE JIB-DOWNHAUL PARTS.

Untoggle the fore-topgallant-bowlines, and knot them together, above
the first hank, between the stay and jib-halliards, which use for a
downhaul, until you reeve a new one.

=344.=--TO CHASE.

A vessel that chases another should have the advantage in point of
sailing, because if the ship chased is as good a sailer as the chaser,
the latter can never come up to her, if she manœuvred equally as well.

In order to determine whether your ship sails faster than your
adversary, get upon the same tack, under the same sail, and keep upon
the same course with her; set her exactly with a compass, and if your
ship sails best, the sail will soon draw a point more aft; if she has
the advantage she will in a short time draw more forward, and if both
sail equally well, she will remain at the same point.

=345.=--TO CHASE TO WINDWARD.

[Illustration]

To chase to windward, run upon the same course with the enemy, until he
is brought perpendicularly to the same course; when tack and continue
the second board, until he is again brought perpendicularly to the same
course; always continue this manœuvre by tacking every time the chase
is a-beam, on either board, and she will come in the shortest method by
your superiority of sailing. Should the chase pass the point, when the
chase bears a-beam, he must go about with all dispatch.

_Note._--The chase goes about as soon as the chase is exactly a-beam,
because at that time, the distance between them is the least possible
upon the different boards they hold.

=346.=--OBSERVATIONS FOR A SHIP TO WINDWARD, WHICH IS CHASED.

[Illustration]

The weather ship will always be joined, since it is granted that she
does not sail as well as the pursuer, it will be then to her advantage
to keep constantly on the same tack, without losing time to heave
about, for tacking cannot be so favorable to her as to her adversary,
whose sailing is superior.

If the chaser mistakingly stands on and tacks in the wake of the chase,
the best course for the latter to pursue is to heave about and pass
to windward of him on the other tack, unless you suppose your vessel
would have a superiority in going large; for if the chaser persists in
tacking in the wake of the other ship, the chase will be much prolonged.

=347.=--TO CHASE TO LEEWARD.

[Illustration]

If the chaser keeps away to cut the chase off, and keeps continually on
that course, they will eventually come together where the two courses
intersect. This will be exactly executed by the ship in chase, if in
the course she has taken, she keeps the chase continually upon the
same degree of the compass as at the beginning of the pursuit. This
principle applies equally to all the courses which the retreating ship
pursues, for if overtaken, it can only be accomplished by keeping in a
straight line, if the chase takes another course than that which keeps
the two ships upon the same point. These are the only considerations
to be made, and they may be corrected, by observing the bearings by an
azimuth compass.

=348.=--TO WINDWARD OF AN ENEMY, WITHIN PISTOL SHOT.--_The weather main
rigging is shot away--both ships with main-topsails to the mast._

Up helm, fill away, and run the enemy on board, before she gets headway
to prevent it.

=349.=--WIND ON THE QUARTER, ALL SAIL SET--BRING BY UNDER DOUBLE-REEFED
TOPSAILS.

Reduce sail regularly, and clew down the topsails; luff enough to reef,
hoist the topsails, and haul close on a wind.

=350.=--WIND ON THE QUARTER, ALL SAIL SET--BRING-TO ON THE OTHER TACK,
UNDER DOUBLE REEFED TOPSAILS.

[Illustration]

Reduce sail to topsails, station the crew forward, with one watch of
topmen aloft to reef; brail up the spanker, up helm, brace in, and
when before the wind, clew down the topsails, haul out reef-tackles,
and up buntlines; let the men lay out and reef; wind on the quarter,
brace up cross-jack yard, and haul out the spanker; as she comes-too,
brace up the fore yard, and meet her with the helm and jib-sheet;
when coming-too, a good opportunity will be offered for reefing; when
reefed, hoist away the topsails, letting the main go a-back, the others
fill.

_Note._--Having a dismasted ship in tow, heave-to, make fast the
stream cable to the mainmast of the ship, and take it in at the
weather gangway, clinching it around the mainmast; then make fast a
stout hawser as a spring, and snatch it to a block lashed amidships
on the taffrail, so that the ship may either ride on the weather
quarter, or be roused astern. In case of veering, rouse in upon the
spring, and the manœuvre will be performed with more certainty. After
it is executed, the tow-rope must be shifted to the opposite gangway,
by means of a spring, &c.

=351.=--HOW TO GET THE ANCHORS OFF THE BOWS.

Hook the fore pendant-tackle; single the shank-painters, and set them
taut with the pendant-tackles; come up the shank-lashings, put the
shoes between the bills and bows, by capstan-bars, and then by the
shank-painters as far as necessary.

Single and set taut cat-head stoppers, and then unlash the rings.

=352.=--TO ANCHOR HEAD TO WIND--WIND FREE.

See that the officers and men are at their stations, and the strictest
silence preserved, as the ship nears her berth; take in all the
studding sails, get the burtons off the yards, and the jiggers off the
topgallant yards; send the booms and sails down from aloft; man the
fore clew-garnets, buntlines and leechlines; the mainsail is hauled up
as the ship is going free; topgallant and royal clewlines; lay aloft
and stand by to furl the sails snug, and square the yards by the lifts
and braces; have hands by the fore tack and sheet, topgallant and
royal sheets, halliards, weather braces, and bowlines; up foresail,
in topgallant-sails and royals; furl the sails snug, and square the
yards by the lifts and braces, hauling taut the halliards. Man the
topsail-clewlines and buntlines, weather braces, jib-downhaul, and
spanker-outhaul; attend the sheets, halliards, and spanker-brails, ease
down the helm, haul down the jib, haul out the spanker, and when the
topsail lifts, clear away the sheets, and clew them up; then let go the
halliards, clew down, and square away the yards immediately; haul aft
the spanker-sheet, and when the headway ceases, stream the buoy, stand
clear of the cable; when she begins to go astern, let go the anchor,
brail up the spanker, crotch the boom, haul taut the guys, light-to the
cable, as fast as she will take it, until a sufficient scope is out,
when stopper. Furl sails, haul taut and stop in the rigging, send the
boats’ crews aft, to lower the boats down. Let the boatswain go ahead
to square the yards--clear up the decks.

_Note._--If in going to moor, veer out double the mooring scope, and
then let go the anchor; then furl sails and heave in.

=353.=--TO ANCHOR ON A LEE SHORE.

The ship being on a lee shore, and no room to veer, recourse must be
had to letting go all the anchors. For this purpose all the cables are
bent and ranged, and all the anchors got ready for letting go; the
weather sheet is bitted to the forward bitts, and the weather bower to
the after bitts, to windward; the lee bower to the forward bitts, and
the lee sheet to the after ones to leeward; no buoy rope is bent except
to the weather sheet; the weather sheet is backed by the stream, and
the other anchors with kedges; see all the tiers clear, get the ship
under storm-staysails, and furl all the square sails; hook the yard
tackles; get the lower yards forward, and house topmast; when all is
ready, keep her a little off, to get headway. Let go the weather sheet
and stream anchors and veer away, then the weather bower and kedge;
down helm; haul down fore and main storm stay-sails, and the drift to
leeward will carry her to the berth of the last anchor, which let go;
haul down the mizen storm stay-sail, and veer away an equal scope on
all four cables; observe that they will bear an equal strain, and veer
to a long scope, reserving sufficient to freshen the nip with;[30]
see that the cables are well rounded, and watch them carefully. If
she should drag, sling the guns with the stoutest spare rigging on
board, having a round turn around all these cables, and heave them
over; if she should still drag, cut away the masts, and if there be no
possibility of preventing her from going on shore, take a stout spring
to one of the quarters, slip the cables, let her veer round and go on
shore end on.[31]

_Note._--In weighing these anchors, bring-to first on the cable which
has got the least scope out, taking in the slack of the others with
deck-tackles.

[30] If they are hemp cables; if chain, it is unnecessary.

[31] See Wrecked in a Gale.

=354.=--SCUDDING UNDER A FORESAIL--TO COME TO AN ANCHOR.

Get both bowers ready for letting go; haul up the foresail, making
a due allowance for headway, and run in under bare poles; when near
the berth, down helm, out with the spanker, and haul aft mizen storm
stay-sail sheet; when by the wind, let go the weather anchor and veer
away briskly; when head to wind, let go the lee anchor, and haul down
the staysail; veer-to, and bring equal strain on both cables. If
necessary, let go more anchors.

=355.=--TO MAKE A FLYING MOOR.

Make all necessary preparations for coming-to; overhaul and bitt a
double range of the weather cable, and bitt the lee one at the range
to which she is to be moored. When approaching the anchorage, reduce
sail to topsails, jib and spanker, if moderate, but if fresh, to jib
and spanker only; when near the berth of the first anchor, luff-to,
stream the buoy, and when the headway has nearly ceased, let go the
weather anchor, up helm, stand on and veer away roundly, to prevent the
range from checking her; when the full range is nearly out, hard down
the helm, down jib, clew up the topsails, out spanker, and let her lay
the range out taut; when taut, let go the lee anchor, _furl sails_,
bring-to on the weather-cable, reeving away on the lee one, and heave
into the moorings. Moor taut, to allow for veering; clap on service,
and veer it; if hemp cable, square the yards, stop in the rigging, and
clear up the decks.

=356.=--TO MOOR WITH A LONG SCOPE OF CHAIN.

Shackle the ends of both chains together, and veer away nearly the
whole of the two cables; then let go the other anchor, bring-to on the
first cable, heave in, veering away on the other; when into the mooring
mark or shackle, stopper and bitt, unshackle the chains, and secure
all; clear up the decks, and pay the chain below. (_See Unmooring and
Mooring._)

=357.=--BLOWING FRESH--IN PORT.

Range the cables, see the anchor clear, and an anchor watch set; have
leads-men in the chains--send down the upper yards, if not already
down; house top-gallant masts, and point the yards to the wind.

=358.=--SEND DOWN LOWER YARDS.

Send aloft the jeer-blocks, lash them, and reeve the jeers; see
the gear of the courses clear, trusses unrove, and lifts clear for
unreeving; hook the yard-tackles and take them forward, heave taut
the jeers, unreeve the lanyard of the slings, attend the braces and
yard-tackles, lower away by the jeers and lifts. When down make all
fast.

=359.=--TO HOUSE TOPMASTS.

Hook top-blocks, reeve pendants and falls, see the rigging clear
that leads to the topmast heads, man the top tackle-falls, slack
the lanyards of the rigging, stays and backstays; sway up, out fid,
lower away, and haul down on the rigging; when low enough, pass
heel-lashings around the lower masts, having canvass in the wake; set
taut the rigging and stays. Sheep-shank the backstays, haul taut the
running-rigging, and make all snug.

_Note._--The topmasts may be housed with the lower yards aloft, by
taking the yard-tackles forward and bousing upon them, slacking the
braces and trusses at the same time (if not patent trusses). The
patent truss has been so improved that the mast can be housed by
unclamping one side and bracing sharp up.

=360.=--TO BACK A BOWER BY A STREAM.

Bend a stream-cable to the flukes of the bower-anchor, observing to let
go the stream first; and when the cable is taut, let go the bower. If
the bower is already down and dragging, form a clinch with the stream,
around the cable, and let her drag until she brings the stream ahead.

=361.=--TO SWEEP FOR AN ANCHOR.

Make use of long stout running-rigging; middle it, and attach some
sinker to the middle, also along the bight, to confine it to the
bottom. Coil it away in two boats, and pull to windward of where the
anchor is supposed to lie; then pull in an opposite direction, veering
away on the bight from both boats; now pull in the direction of the
anchor, and when the bight catches, cross the boats, and get a round
turn with the rope; make a running bowline on the end of a hawser
around the rope, and slip it down; when fast, weigh with the launch.

_Note._--A section of small sized chain, with a rope bent to each
end, is the best means that can be used to sweep for an anchor. Cross
and bring both parts together, after which put on a shackle on both
parts, and let it run down to the anchor; then heave up on both parts.

=362.=--PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING HARBOR.

Inspect the tiller-ropes, shift hard over the helm, once or twice each
way, in order to see that the tiller is not obstructed in its sweep in
the gun-room. Place lead-lines in both channels. Point the ends of the
hawsers up the hatchways, ready for paying out in any direction. Range
both bower cables; see stoppers placed in readiness (bitt and ring).
Examine cat-head stoppers, and shank-painters of both bower-anchors.

Should the shank-painters be fitted slip-shackle fashion, care should
be taken to place men by them who are acquainted with the method of
disengaging the anchors, &c.

=363.=--WEIGHING ANCHOR IN A HEAD-SEA.

In weighing anchor with a head-sea, precaution should be taken to have
previously prepared a good deck-tackle or other purchase, which affix
to the messenger (if required), to assist the action of the capstan.
There should also be had in readiness an ample quantity of nippers.
(_See Passing Nippers._)

=364.=--CASTING, OR CUTTING THE CABLE.

When at single anchor in a roadstead, and if it be apprehended that
from the direction of the wind, and the local position of the ship with
the shore, it may be necessary to have recourse to cutting the cable,
and that casting the wrong way would endanger the safety of the vessel,
timely precaution should be taken to ensure the ships casting in the
right direction.

To effect this purpose, the stream cable should be bent to that of
the riding bower, brought through the after part, and taken round the
capstan, in readiness to act as a spring, to cant the ship previously
to cutting. Axes should be placed abaft in the vicinity of the stream
cable, for the purpose of cutting it, after the bower has been severed,
and the ship’s head cast the desired way.

_Note._--A slip or buoy-rope should be brought over “head,” so that
when the cable is cut, a buoy may be left in the roadstead to denote
the position of the anchor.

=365.=--CLINCHING CABLES.

Whatever be the number of hemp cables which are bent to the anchors,
the officer in charge is particularly cautioned to clap on a clinch
rounding, towards the inner extremity of each cable, keeping three
sheaves in the tier; upon receiving the cables on board, and clinching
their respective ends, the officer may proceed as given in the note
below.

Chain-cables should never be clinched in a manner which will not admit
of their ends being immediately disengaged, in the event of it becoming
necessary to slip, or extricate the ship from her anchors; it may be
said, that the cable may be unshackled on deck, but it may so happen,
that the last shackle is without the hawse--a circumstance which will
preclude the possibility of having recourse to this expedient.

_Note._--Pay down three sheaves into the tier, and then clap on a
racking lashing to the fore beam, previously worming and parceling in
the wake of the lashing; measure then, allowing the cable bitted, and
clap on a rounding in the wake, where the cable would bring up in the
hawse, and chafe in the cutwater. This method leaves room to freshen
hawse, in the event of having to veer to the clinch. Few ships adopt
the precaution of clapping upon their cables a clinch service; when
too late, the necessity of the practice is discovered.

=366.=--FITTING BUOY-ROPES.

Buoy-ropes are always proportioned to the depth of water. One end
is unlaid, and a buoy rope-knot made; it is then laid up again, and
whipped. A clove hitch is made, one half of the hitch being on each
side of the crown. The end with the knot is seized on the shank, one
seizing put on close to the crown, and one close to the end. The other
is bent to the buoy. Some prefer the running eye. Put over one arm, and
a half-hitch over the other arm, and seized in the cross.

=367.=--JIB-HALLIARDS WITH A WHIP.

A piece of rope, nearly equal to the double halliards, is rove through
the block at the mast-head, and hooked to the head of the jib, a hook
being spliced in the end; in the other a single block is spliced high
enough from the deck to allow the jib being hauled close down. Through
this block reeve a fall, and send both ends down through lubber’s-hole;
splice a hook in one end, and hook into a bolt; reeve the other through
a leading-block. Objections have been made to whips, but if the
standing part is put a good distance from the hauling, it is impossible
that it can take turns in--they can lead abaft the top if necessary.
I should recommend their being brought down immediately forward of
topsail halliards.

=368.=--JIB SHEETS, DOUBLE.

Two single blocks are seized into one strap, as span blocks, and the
strap secured to the clew[32] of the sail, with a lashing passed
through it, and an eye formed in the strap by crossing both parts
together, and passing a throat seizing. One end of the sheet is
clinched or spliced into an eye-bolt in the bulwarks, the other
end rove through the block in the sail, from out, in and through a
fair-leader or sheave in the bulwarks.

With pendants, a piece of rope of sufficient size and length is
middled, crossed, and a throat seizing passed round both parts, having
an eye in the bight large enough to take a lashing. In each of these
pendants, splice a single block; reeve a whip the same as in the double
sheets. The pendants should be long enough to allow the weather one to
hang slack on the fore-topmast stay, when the sheet is aft. (_See Sail
Table for iron clews._)

[32] Iron clews being fitted to all sails, the strap would be likely
to chafe. I would recommend snug clump sister-hooks, or shackles,
fitted to the clews.

=369.=--WRECKED IN A GALE.

When this sad fate appears inevitable, it would be well to make choice
(if choice can be made), of what appears the best part of the coast,
and the clearest from rocks, for beaching her.

The manner in which the boatmen beach their boats, is by laying them,
with the assistance of the helm, half-broadside on, or rather bow and
quarter on, having previously given the vessel a _heel_, _or list in
shore_. This may be done either by trimming, or by the sallying of
the crew, before the time that the vessel takes the ground. Such a
position will offer the best means of saving the crew, who may also be
materially assisted by cutting away the masts, so as to fall towards
the shore, which may be the means of assisting those on board to reach
the shore.

In establishing a communication with the shore, if it be by a boat, the
end of the deep sea-lead line should be taken in her, or if it be by
some good swimmer, with a cork jacket on, the end of the log line will
serve the same purpose; by either of these, hawsers, or other large
ropes may afterwards be got on shore.

The means of getting on shore from a wreck are by life boats, rafts,
parts of the wreck, or life preservers.

A canvass cot, with large holes at the bottom, to admit the water to
pass through freely, and having cross bars of thick rope, should also
be kept in readiness for such an occasion.

Raw-hide rope will be the best for traveling grommets. Some other
expedients might be mentioned, which are for the consideration of
officers in charge of vessels.

=370.=--SETTING UP RIGGING AT SEA.

Whenever it is required to set up the lower shrouds, at sea, the
topmast shrouds should be all let go; this practice is recommended upon
the presumption that the lower rigging will not be cast loose, or set
up on the occasion of a swell, or that the ship be rolling or pitching.
It has been well observed, that by letting go two topmast shrouds at
a time, an uneven strain has been brought upon the futtock;[33] which
prevents the shrouds of the lower rigging being equally drawn down.

Upon all occasions of setting up the lower rigging at sea, it is always
advisable to have ready prepared as many luffs as possible, so that
the shrouds may be set up at a time, and that there may be no delay
in shifting the tackles from shroud to shroud. When the lower rigging
is up, the futtock plates should be beaten down to the top, and the
shrouds set tautly up by means of tackles, ready hooked to their
respective lanyards. The method of employing the Spanish windlass, for
the purpose of setting up these shrouds, is not to be recommended. It
occupies too much time, and often creates unnecessary delay before the
topmast rigging can be set up. In staying the topmasts, the boatswain
is not recommended to bouse too far forward the heads of the mast,
and he should recollect that the angle formed by the main topmast
stay, with the fore top, is considerably greater than that of the fore
topmast with the bowsprit; and consequently that the lever of the
former is more powerful than that of the latter.

_Note._--Vessels not having catharpen legs, need not come up the
topmast rigging for the purpose of setting up lower rigging, as the
futtock-shrouds set up to the mast.

[33] This is only applicable to vessels having their futtock-rigging
set up to their lower rigging.

=371.=--SLACKING THE JIB-STAY, IN BAD WEATHER.

The jib-stay is always set up as taut as a bar of iron; consequently,
when it comes to a blow, both the spray of the sea and the rain tend to
tauten it more; in pitching, too, it must assist to spring the boom,
work the bowsprit, and cause unnecessary strain upon the rope itself.
Whenever it blows so fresh that the jib is not likely to be set, the
jib-stay should be slacked. If it be required subsequently to setting
the sail, nothing can be easier than to set the stay up, while the jib
is loosing. (_Bear this in mind._)

=372.=--STOPPING OUT TOPGALLANT YARD ROPES.

The practice of permitting the topmen to stop the topgallant yard ropes
out at their own convenience, and consequently at unstated periods,
is at variance with that order and regularity which should ever
characterize the duties and discipline of a vessel of war.

In well regulated ships, the officer of the watch, following the
movements of the senior officers, directs the boatswain or his mates
to pipe “out yard ropes;” if tripping-lines are tolerated, the yard
rope and tripping-line men should lay out together: by pursuing this
system the yards will be kept square, and will not (as is of constant
occurrence), be seen for an hour and a half before sunset, topping in
different directions. The same rule should be observed when placing on
whips for hammock-girtlines, or clothes-lines.

=373.=--PREVENTER BRACES.

It is desirable to establish a general rule, that when the topsails are
treble-reefed, the preventer braces are to be placed on the yards, and
that the relieving tackles in the gun room be placed at hand ready for
use.

=374.=--KEEPING A CLEAR ANCHOR.

That part of seamanship which relates to the method of tending a ship
to the tide, or in other words of keeping the cable clear of the
anchor, may not be inaptly termed the blind branch of the mariner’s
art--the buoy floating on the surface being the only possible guide
that the seaman possesses to point to the position of the anchor hidden
under water.

From being little understood, and by young officers it is seldom put
in practice, the art of keeping a clear anchor is by many considered
a difficult task; but, were officers to give more attention to the
matter, and to place less dependence on the master or pilot, they would
soon attain every necessary knowledge to meet the most difficult tide
case.

=375.=--ANCHOR TURNING IN THE GROUND.

[Illustration]

In order to ensure the certainty of an anchor turning in the ground,
with the tending or swinging of the ship, it is recommended (whenever
it is possible), to resort to this practice: To shoot the ship on the
same side of her anchor, at each change of tide; for if the anchor
should not turn in the ground, the cable will get foul, either about
the stock or upper fluke, and trip it out of ground. (Remember this).

=376.=--TO TEND TO A WEATHER-TIDE.

Let it be supposed that a ship is riding at single anchor, upon a
lee-tide, with the wind in the same direction as the tide, and that
it be required, upon the tide setting to windward, to tend the ship
clear of the anchor. To effect this, as soon as the ship begins to
feel the turn of the weather-tide, and that the vessel brings the wind
broad on the weather-bow, the head sails should be hoisted, and the
lee-sheets hauled aft, in order to shoot the ship from her anchor, on
a taut cable. The helm must be put “a-lee,” and kept in that position
until the tide sets the ship over to windward of her cable, and the
buoy appears on the same side with the helm. If from light winds the
buoy bears nearly a-beam, her head sails may be hauled down; but if the
breeze be strong, and it causes the ship to shoot in a direction nearly
end-on with that of the cable, bringing the buoy on her quarter, it
will be necessary to keep the fore-topmast-staysail set, in order to
check the vessel, should she be disposed to break her shear against the
action of her helm, or be inclined to drop to windward and “go over”
her anchor, in a broadside or lateral direction.

=377.=--A MAN OVERBOARD, AT SEA.

If the ship be going free, and particularly if fast through the water,
it is recommended to bring-to with the head-yards a-back, for it is
obvious if the main-yard be left square, the ship will be longer
coming-to, will shoot farther, increase the distance from the man, and
add materially to the delay of succor.

It will however require judgment, especially if blowing fresh, to be
careful and right the helm in time, or the ship will fly-to too much,
gain sternway, and risk the boat in lowering down.

The best authority recommends, that if possible, the ship should not
only be hove a-back when a man falls overboard, but she ought to be
brought around on the other tack; of course sail ought to be shortened
in stays, and the main-yard kept square. This implies the ship being on
a wind, or from the position of having the wind not above two points
abaft the beam.

The great merit of such a method of proceeding, is, that if the
evolution succeeds, the ship when round will drift towards the man,
and although there may be some small risk in lowering the boat in
stays from the ship, having at one period sternway, there will in fact
be little time lost, if the boat be not lowered until the ship be
well round, and the sternway at an end. There is more mischief done
generally, by lowering the boat too soon, than by waiting until the
fittest moment arrives for doing it coolly. It cannot be too often
repeated, that almost the whole depends upon the self-possession of the
officer of the deck.

=378.=--JIB AND STAYSAIL-HALLIARD. (_Blocks at mast-head._)

For various reasons it is advisable to dispense with the cheek-blocks,
which are usually fitted to the fore topmast-head, for the purpose
of reeving the above two ropes, together with the fore topmast
staysail-halliards. In the first place, if the fore-topmast be sprung,
or carried away in chase, and it be required to shift the mast with all
possible speed, considerable time is taken up in removing and replacing
cheek-blocks at the mast-head. (_See allowance-table, Blocks._)

_Note._--In some ships the jib and fore-topmast staysail-halliards
are rove through gins fitted for the purpose. Gins, however, are not
supplied in all ships, but you can always fit fiddle-blocks under
the eyes of your rigging; your jib and staysail-halliards reeve in
the upper sheaves, and the topsail-buntlines in the lower ones.
Cheek-blocks answer well on the trestle-trees.

=379.=--TO KEEP THE HAWSE CLEAR WHEN MOORED.

When it is nearly slack water, cant her with the helm the right way,
and if necessary, make use of jib, spanker, and yards.

=380.=--TO TEND TO WINDWARD--SINGLE ANCHOR.

When the tide slacks, sheer her with the helm, run up the jib and
fore-topmast staysail, with weather-sheets aft; when canted the
right way, the lee-sheets may be hauled aft, and the yards filled,
thus setting her abreast to a taut cable; when the buoy is on the
lee-quarter, brace the head-yards to the wind, and fill the after ones;
when the tide swings her head around so as to shake the sails, haul
down and stow them.

=381.=--TO TEND TO LEEWARD.

As the tide slackens, sheer her to the same side of the buoy on which
she came to windward, and fill the yards, which will set her end-on
over the cable; she will now by the effect of the wind, bring her stern
over the cable, and bring the buoy on her weather-quarter; put the helm
“a-weather,” and she will shoot ahead, tautening the cable, by sheering
her head from the wind. When the wind gets a little aft the beam, hoist
the jib, to prevent the cable from drawing her head to wind.

Let her lay in this position until she falls off; when the headsails
shake, haul down and stow them.

=382.=--TO BACK SHIP--(AT ANCHOR).

As the tide slacks, sheer her to windward, sheet-home and set the
mizen-topsail; thus she will back round to leeward as soon as the tide
sets up; clew up and furl the mizen-topsail.

=383.=--TO BREAK THE SHEAR.

When tending to the tide, and the ship comes over her anchor, she may
break her shear by canting her stern the wrong way; when this is the
case put the helm “a-weather,” run the jib up, fill the head-yards, and
the after-yards kept-to. Everything is now arranged to bring her round
again, when she must be managed as before mentioned.

=384.=--ON GETTING TO SEA.

[Illustration]

Unship the man-ropes, stow them away, secure the gangways, pay down
the messenger, and secure anchors and boats. The anchors ought to be
secured with preventer stoppers, and painters, particularly where they
work with a slip-shackle or tricker, which a rope catching, may drag or
drive out. In fact the jib-sheet is apt to do this if not looked to.

Wash and dry the nippers, then stow them away; wash down the anchors
and buoys, and black them as soon as possible; when clear of the land,
unbend cables, buoys, and buoy-ropes, and ship the blind-buckles,
unless prevented by peculiar circumstances.

Take off the harbor-gaskets and have them repaired and blackened
afresh, when convenient. If the bunt-gaskets, however, are retained on
the yards, roll them up snug and secure them. Put the sea-gaskets on,
make them up in cheises, and keep them before the yards.

Place bunt-line spans to their respective yards.

Have the boats’ sails and awnings dried and put below.

Quarter-boats clear for lowering.

Besides these, the watch on deck, when not employed in more pressing
duties, may be occupied to much advantage as follows, viz.:

1*st.* Exercising small-arms, cutlasses and guns;

2*d.* Pointing all ropes requiring it;

3*d.* Working up a sufficient quantity of junk, into seizing-stuff,
mats, swabs, foxes, thumb-lines, knittles, gaskets, reef-points,
nippers, salvagees, straps, &c., &c.

=385.=--ON FIRE REGULATIONS IN THE MERCHANT-SERVICE.

We now come to the most important of all the regulations in a ship,
namely, those which operate against the fatal and shocking effects of
fire. Whatever good results from stationing people in ordinary cases,
cannot be put in competition with this, which provides against the most
dreadful catastrophe incident to a ship. From the number of unfortunate
accidents of this nature we surely ought to be prepared to our utmost
for such an event.

First, by internal precautions; and

Secondly, by the means to be used against the danger.

Let there be great attention in the use of fire and lights.--The
regulations on these subjects which exist in men of war are still more
required in merchant vessels.

Fires should be put out at eight P. M., and all lights at nine P. M.,
except those required for the binnacle, and on deck.

The officer of the last dog-watch ought to report the fire extinguished
to the captain.

As each man is relieved from the wheel, he should examine below, and
report “all well” to the officer of the watch.

No naked light whatever ought to be permitted; let either lanterns or
lamps be used.

Spirits should be drawn off by day; a naked light should on no account
be permitted near a spirit cask.

Smoking should not be allowed below. I have known more than one ship
set on fire by a man’s pipe; and by segars, I have no doubt many have
been burnt.

In stowing a hold, do not allow naked lights to be used, nor any person
to smoke there when so employed.

On receiving cotton as a cargo, both those who ship as well as those
who receive it, ought to ascertain that it is in a safe state before
it be put on board. I have known instances of its being sold and moved
away, when, in a few hours, if it had not been moved, it would have
ignited.

I am acquainted with the particulars of a ship that was burnt some
years since, where oil had been stowed in the hold with cotton over
it, with what was considered safe and secure dunnage between. The
cotton, notwithstanding, absorbed a quantity of oil, became heated, and
ignited. The crew with difficulty saved themselves in the boats before
the flames burst forth, and the vessel was entirely consumed.

Chests containing bottles of inflammable substances, such as vitriol,
&c., cannot be too well secured. A medicine chest upset in a gale may
set fire to a ship.

Friction matches should never be allowed on board a ship.

The coals in steamers have frequently taken fire, and in many cases
with the most fatal consequences. Too much care cannot be taken in the
selection of coals; a strict examination ought to be made as to their
state when received and stowed, and no suspicious circumstances should
be then overlooked. When receiving coals, avoid throwing the fresh ones
on the old, which ought to be kept uppermost, and _first_ for use. When
once they become ignited, I can hardly offer a remedy for the evil.

When coals take fire, some people throw water upon them, and smother
the fire by wet beds. Hot water, or steam, if they can be used, are
more expeditious than cold water in extinguishing fire, I believe. To
attempt to discharge the coals, would allow the air freer access, and
would be certain to increase the power of the fire.

A few canvass buckets, with long lanyards, should be always prepared
and ready on deck for drawing water.

When a fire is first discovered, shorten all low sails directly,
courses up, stay-sails and wind-sails down, boat-covers taken off.

If the sails should take fire from lightning, or any other cause,
cutting away the mast appears the most likely method of saving the ship.

At first, endeavor if possible, to stifle the fire; which may be best
done by shutting off any draught of air, and smothering it with wet
bedding, small sails, &c., until a good supply of water can be applied.

If the fire is forward, put before the wind until it is necessary to
“out boats,” then bring-to.

If the fire is aft, or a-midships, keep to the wind.

=386.=--STATION BILL FOR FIRE, IN THE MERCHANT SERVICE.[34]

Coolness and steadiness in any misfortune by fire are essential to
arrest it.

If a fire break out below, the hatchways should be immediately covered,
to prevent a draught of air.

Ring the ship’s bell to call the men to their stations.

======================================================================

If the ship cannot be saved, the passengers and crew are the first

Bowditch. Unless there is sufficient time, and it can be done without
endangering the sea-worthiness of the boats, nothing should be taken
that is not essential to the mere preservation of life, and necessary
for navigating the boats.

[34] This bill ought to be written out or printed, and hung up for
every one’s inspection.

[35] The mate ought to have the key of the valves of the water tanks
in his own keeping.

=387.=--TAKING TO THE BOATS.

The captain should in his own mind, and by a private memorandum,
station the passengers and crew to the boats on board, and likewise
make the persons here specified be responsible for having the following
articles put into the boats.

With a scarcity of food, savages attempt to lessen the cravings of
hunger by tightening a belt around the waist; and by sucking a pebble
they in some degree alleviate thirst. Chewing tobacco may also be
serviceable under such circumstances. In such emergencies all must fare
alike.

=388.=--LOSING A RUDDER AT A CRITICAL MOMENT, (_such as crossing a Bar,
&c._)

A ship might lose her rudder at a critical moment in crossing the bar
of a river, when a few minutes more might run her aground, if she were
unmanageable; and in this case, what temporary rudder is best becomes
a question for which a few moments only are given to decide. The plan
of steering by the stream-cable payed out astern, or by the stern-boat
lowered instantly, with the plug out, and towed astern by a hawser,
with guys leading up to each quarter, would perhaps then be adopted;
while a ship losing her rudder at sea would have leisure to adopt any
other plan.

It might be an advantage, if every vessel would take some opportunity
of trying how she could steer with a stern-boat in the manner
described, and what length of tow-line was required to enable her to
steer the most easily, so as to avoid wild yawing. The experiment might
be made in moderate weather with the wind on the quarter, and also
right aft, under top-sails, top-gallant-sails and fore-sail, running
five or six knots. Nothing gives confidence so much as practice.

=389.=--STEAMERS GETTING AGROUND.

As steamers would probably do so with very fresh way on, they ought at
once to stop their engines, but on _no account_ to attempt to reverse
them, until the extent of the injury be ascertained; otherwise they
may go down in deep water. Their first duty is to out boats, and place
the passengers in safety in them; the crew might then ascertain the
state of the vessel; if she is likely to float, and can be got off, the
attempt to do so should be made; but if not, the crew can take to the
boats.

=390.=--ON THE DUTY OF REMAINING BY A DAMAGED VESSEL.

When two vessels have run foul of each other, the one which is the
least injured is bound, by every sense of justice and humanity, to
stay by the other to render every assistance in her power; a contrary
proceeding ought to make the guilty party liable to some punishment. If
one appears likely to sink, the boat lashings should be cut, that the
boat or boats may be got out or float off.

PART VII.

MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS.

=391.=--ON SQUARING YARDS.

Simple as may seem the process of squaring yards, it is nevertheless a
piece of duty which requires considerable precision, and this precision
can never be obtained without a knowledge of the principle upon which
the yards should be squared. A boatswain, ignorant of this principle,
will generally proceed thus: he first bouses taut the lower trusses,
squares the yards by the braces, and, quite regardless of the distance
of the topsail-yards from their respective caps, or looking to see if
the yards are a-midships, directs the chief boatswain’s mate to take
his station on the end of the jib-boom, whilst he himself proceeds in
the boat ahead of the ship to square the yards by the lifts. Should the
fore-yard be required to be topped to starboard, the boatswain will
top away upon the yard-arm until, _by chance_, he discovers he has
topped it too high; to remedy this eye sore, he sings out “_Fore-yard
to port_,” and tops until he raises the larboard arm as high as the
starboard; producing by this system of topping, and never settling, a
most unsightly bow in the yard. He then squares the fore-topsail yard
by the bowed fore-yard, and of course treats the fore-topsail yard to
a bit of a bend likewise. He then takes the main yard in hand, which,
though probably square by the lifts, can no longer look so in his
eye, because the yard arms are not made to cock up like those of the
fore yard. “_Main yard to starboard_,” he sings out, with an audible
voice; the lift is topped several feet to starboard, and then to port,
until the yard assumes the desired cock the boatswain has in his eye
in squaring the loftier yards by the lifts. Boatswains seldom take the
precaution to place hands to tend the top-gallant braces. It should be
remembered that the topping of the lifts alter and disturb the square
position of the yards by the braces. These may appear minute matters,
but unless they be strictly observed, yards never can be properly
squared.

In squaring yards by the lifts, the lanyards should always be unrove to
two or three turns, the jigger hooked to them and hauled taut; and when
topping on one lift always ease the opposite lanyard with the jigger;
if not, the lanyard will render with jerks, and the yard will probably
have to be topped the opposite way. The lanyards should be rocked
when sufficiently up, the plan of nipping with hands being a lazy,
bad practice; and after much time spent in getting the yards nicely
squared, the lanyards have come up in securing. The ropes should be all
hauled taut before the boat comes on board; all the ropes coiled neatly
and low in the tops; nothing allowed to hang over the bows, which
should be kept quite clear; and everything done to make the ship appear
in every respect what a man-of-war ought to be.

Being particular in one part and not in another, has almost a worse
appearance than slovenly altogether. As the ship is considered a
would-be _man-of-war_, and is the cause of many remarks, which, if
heard by the commanding officer, would not be at all complimentary
to his nautical knowledge, if anything should be studied more than
another, it is the standing rigging and position of the masts and
yards, &c., &c.

_Note._--Before squaring the yards, the boatswain is recommended to
see that the masts, and particularly the lofty spars, are upright
and all in one. It frequently happens that after the boatswain
has squared all the yards, fore and aft, he detects an awkward
inclination in one of the topgallant-masts; he nevertheless returns
on board, and reports to the senior lieutenant, yards squared and
ropes taut, but afterwards desires the captain of the top to get
a pull on the starboard or larboard top-gallant breast-backstay,
forgetting that this very pull affects the top-gallant lifts, and
consequently alters the position of the yards. The first thing after
the masts are all in one, or upright, as you choose to term it, is to
get your yards exactly amidships by rolling-tackles; then get them
snugly trussed to the mast, and square them by the braces, before
proceeding ahead of the ship.

=392.=--UP TOP-GALLANT MASTS AND YARDS--(_The Masts, &c. being on
deck._)

One watch of topmen aloft, to get jack or tail blocks on, for yard
ropes, as also for _flying jib and staysail halliards_; if the sails
are about to be loosed, have jiggers on the topgallant stays, ready
for setting up, and burtons overhauled, ready for clapping on the
mast ropes; in fidding, the other watch see everything clear, and get
tackles on the backstays, ready for setting up the instant the mast is
stayed.

WORDS OF COMMAND.

“_All hands, up topgallant-masts and yards_,”--and loose sails if
requisite.

“_Sway away_,”--let the masts wait for each other, after placing the
topgallant rigging, so that they may afterwards ascend uniformly, and
be fidded together. Instantly the fids are in, _stay topgallant-masts_,
and set up the quarter, or standing backstays; then without waiting for
more of the rigging, proceed to cross topgallant-yards alone, along
with the loosing of the sails, as may be requisite, and as is described
in 394.

_Remarks._--The mast-heads and eyes of the rigging, or funnels,
should be greased.

If topgallant-sails are unbent, and royal yard-ropes good, it will
make the work of crossing topgallant-yards all the easier, to use
_royal_ in place of topgallant-yard ropes.

If there be no capshore, the topmast cap is apt to droop forward,
and by _catching_ and _jaming_ the topgallant-masts, to interfere
materially in the attempt to send them up smartly; the caps ought
therefore to be well looked after. If the topgallant, royal, and
skysail masts, be all in one, it is generally found necessary to let
fall the bunts of the topsails, in order to get the masts up; at sea
the yards must be braced up, the topsails lowered two-thirds down,
and the mast sent up to windward.

=393.=--DOWN TOPGALLANT-MASTS AND YARDS.

One watch, or part of a watch of topmen, aloft, to clear away the
topgallant rigging, unreeve flying-jib and staysail-halliards, get jack
or tail-blocks on, for royal and topgallant yard-ropes, and burtons on
the mast-ropes.

The other watch of topmen on deck, unlace the backstay-mats, and slack
the backstay lanyards.

When ready, “_sway away_,” two hands at the mast-head looking out for
the fids, the lanyards of which they should be cautioned to see fast;
and two on topsail-yard to bear the heel clear, and make fast heel-rope.

When the fids are out, hang the backstays to the tops, lower all the
masts together, and get heel-ropes on, which should be in readiness,
from the deck to the fid-holes.

If the rigging does not start easily, sway and surge without delay;
clap on the lizard through the royal-halliard sheave-hole, as soon as
it can be got at; then lower the masts on deck, either placing them
fore and aft, or up and down the lower masts.

Haul the rigging and backstays taut down from the mastheads, and stop
them down along the topmast rigging, coiling away the slack bights snug
in the tops; also haul taut the stays and all the small ropes.

See that the trucks are fairly placed, so that the signal-halliards may
traverse freely.

If the masts are only housed, haul the topgallant rigging and backstays
taut, as above, but stay the royal-masts, and sheepshank and set up the
royal backstays and shrouds, if there be any, or what is preferable,
stop the slack part in bights, and then set up; also steady the heels
of the topgallant-masts to the topmast by a heel-rope.

_Remarks._--The yards, according to circumstances, may be either sent
down at the moment you begin to lower the masts, or at that when you
begin to sway the masts, in order to take out the fid. The former
has the best effect, but in that case it is essential to have picked
hands to lower, and not to commence lowering until the lower yard-arm
is unrigged.

=394.=--CROSSING TOPGALLANT AND ROYAL-YARDS, AND LOOSING SAIL.

That all the squadron may be prepared to cross yards and loose sail
at _eight_, or for any other manœuvre, deemed proper at the hoisting
of the colors, the flag ship sometimes makes it a rule to designate
seven bells, that is 7 H. 30 M., by giving the preparatory signal.
The squadron have then an opportunity of regulating their time by the
Commodore’s, and making such preparations for eight as may be necessary.

If this be done, and another very proper rule enforced, viz.: the
allowing no one, on any account, to be aloft between five minutes
before eight, and the time of making the signal, every ship will be
upon an equal footing in the keen competition which immediately ensues.

PREPARATIONS.

Send the hands aloft to overhaul the lifts and braces; prepare
studding-sail-booms for tricing up, bend the top bowlines to the
buntline toggles, overhaul the gear of the courses, coiling it snug
down on the lower yards, and take the cloths and half the gaskets off
the fore and aft sail; also stretch along and reeve the yard-ropes.

WORDS OF COMMAND.

“All hands, cross yards and loose sails;”

“Aloft, topmen;”

“Aloft, sail loosers;”

Sway out of the chains--viz.: upper topgallant yard-arms clear of
top-rims, or lubber’s-hole; royal yard-arms clear of cross-trees.

“Sway away;” trice up, lay out.

“Sway across--let fall,”--the men at the same time hoisting jibs and
staysails, hauling out the bowlines, getting down the squaring-marks of
topgallant and royal lifts and braces, and hoisting ensign, jack, and
pendant.

A boat should then be manned without delay, for the boatswain to go
ahead, look at the yards, see the head-sails taut up, the bowline
properly out, and everything ready for shortening sail.

If the bowlines are not to be hauled out, and, in consequence, the jibs
and staysails not hoisted, nor the sheets of trysail and spanker hauled
aft, proceed as follows, viz.:--

Keep fast the topsail clewlines, and haul up the buntlines; throw the
jibs out off the booms without touching the halliards, and slack off
the trysail and spanker-brails; overhaul the brails on one side and
haul them up--on the other loose the small sails enough for the wind to
blow through, which will prevent their heating, and even should it rain
slightly, will avert much harm.

_Remark._--The frequent loosing of the sails is essential, to prevent
them from _mildewing_, particularly when new, and before the gum has
been shaken out.

=395.=--TOPMAST CARRIED AWAY.

I would recommend vessels to use curb-chain, for parrels for
topsail-yards; let it be wormed, parceled and covered with leather;
the seizings must be frequently examined. Carrying away a parrel may
occasion a serious loss of life, should there happen to be any men on
the yard at the time, and even if there are not, this accident is very
likely to carry away the topmast.

The funnels used for top-gallant rigging, are frequently used for
topmast rigging; they are also very serviceable, and if a topmast is
carried away, the funnel is then invaluable, as the topmast may be
shifted so much more quickly, the rigging remaining properly placed.

=396.=--CLEARING THE WRECK OF A TOPMAST.

Watch on deck to secure the wreck, and prevent its doing injury--watch
below to shorten sail. Hook top-blocks, reeve in them two hawsers; the
stoutest to leeward, for passing round and securing the wreck, in order
to get the rigging &c. in-board.

Hook luff-tackles in the lower pendants--let the other topgallant
yards be sent down, and the topgallant masts housed until the topmast
is shifted. If it be a fore-topmast that is carried away, ease in
the jib-boom--cut the lanyards of the topmast rigging, securing the
dead-eyes by studding-sail-halliards.

The weather-hawser may be employed to unfid the stump.

=397.=--CARRYING AWAY A JIB-BOOM.

Send down the fore-topgallant-yard, and house the fore-topgallant-mast;
use the fore-topmast staysail-halliards, and lee-fore-bowline, for
securing and getting in the wreck.

=398.=--TO FISH A LOWER YARD IN THE SHORTEST TIME.

Incalculable are the evils which may result to a vessel from the
springing or snapping of a lower yard, especially the fore one.

If the yard be severed, get both pieces down on deck, and place them
together, to assume, as near as possible, their original position.
Hollow out, so as to fit the cylindrical surface of the yard, two
spare anchor-stock pieces, (or two proper fishes always fitted, and
to be kept as spare stores), in doing which, a depth of two or three
inches will suffice; place one piece on the top, and the other secured
to the under part of the yard, towards the extremities; dub down the
superfluous wood, and round the edges, ready to receive the requisite
wooldings.

Previous to boring holes for the bolts, set close-to the anchor-stock
pieces, with wedge upon wedge; introduce then eight bolts, of
three-quarter inch diameter, which must be severally clinched. Cut
scores for eight wooldings, and woold away with _well-stretched rope_,
of two-and-a-half inch. The yard may then be replaced aloft. There will
be found no necessity for studding-sail booms, or other spare spars.

=399.=--EXPECTATION OF LOSING A LOWER MAST.

Every vessel should have a spare lower cap on board; it should be in
two parts (for the convenience of stowing), with bolts for securing it
together.

In the event of losing a lower mast, the cap put on the spare topmasts,
and then raised on the stump of the lower mast (having been previously
fitted for it), at once enables a jury mast to be stopped and secured;
clap on a good heel lashing.

Those vessels which have lower dead-eyes secured to the side, are
enabled to get clear of the wreck of a lower mast more readily than
those with the old channels and chain plates. Those which are fitted
in the last mentioned manner, when likely to lose a lower mast, should
reeve a hawser through the lanyards of the rigging on each side, and
have it well secured; they will then be enabled to disengage the
lanyards from the channels, and get clear of the wreck, whose thumping
might otherwise injure either the ship’s bottom or rudder.

=400.=--LYING-TO IN A GALE, AFTER THE LOSS OF MASTS.

Put a stout span on a spare topmast or other large spar, and veer a
long scope on a hawser, or stream chain-cable, from the bow, by a
spring on it from aft; it may be used for wearing. The wreck of a mast
would answer well for lying-to with, and when the weather became fine,
the spars and rigging would materially assist in refitting jury masts.

=401.=--SPARS TO CONVERT IN CASE OF NEED.

Officers will do well to consider what spars they have on board which
can be the most readily and efficiently converted, so as to supply the
place of any which may be lost.

A spare topmast, or if in a brig, a main-boom, are the spars that could
be the most quickly converted into a jury lower mast, or bowsprit; a
mizen-mast would be still better, if the weather would permit its being
shifted.

A topmast studding-sail boom, with the sail as a lug, makes a
sufficiently good mizen.

If the bowsprit is sprung, let the jib-boom be eased in nearly to the
bulwark. When a vessel is lying-to, and there is a heavy sea running,
it would be prudent to have tackles up for steadying the foremast, as
in the event of the bowsprit being struck, and either sprung or carried
away, the mast would be saved.

A jib-boom will answer well for making a topsail yard.

_Note._--It is surprising how well vessels answer when jury rigged,
and in many cases will sail nearly as fast as when they have their
proper masts, yards, and sails.

Sails may be reduced by taking out midship cloths, and by the head
for depth.

When vessels take the ground, from a falling tide, or any other
cause, they ought to be prepared with three shores on a side, the
lower ends a little off.

The first abreast the foremast;

The second amidships;

The third abaft the main-sheet sheave.

A measure should be previously taken of the exact depth from the
bulwark to the ground. The lower end of the shores require some
weight, and a flat piece for a shoe secured on each, if the ground is
soft. On the upper end of each shore there should be a cleat on the
fore side and after side, for securing the lashing to the bulwark.

For small vessels, two shores on each side would be sufficient;
one might be under the fore, and one under the main channel. The
preparation of shores will be found to be a very useful one;
many vessels fall over on the water leaving them, and then run
considerable risk of filling, or not righting again.

=402.=--GETTING AGROUND.

If a vessel gets aground (the weather being moderate), first get over
the spare topmasts on one side, and the jib-boom on the other, as
shores abreast of the mainmast, or a little before it; secure some
weight to the heel of each; a few shot, or a light pig of ballast will
do for that purpose, and if the ground is soft, nail on a piece of
plank as a shoe. Furl sails, out all boats, down topgallant yards, and
send topgallant masts on deck; start water, and pump it out; lay out a
bower anchor; be sure that it is so laid that the ship does not ground
on it.

Every officer should make himself well acquainted with the readiest
mode of hanging and carrying out a bower anchor, as far as relates to
the weight of those belonging to his own vessel, and the description of
boats he has to use. If he cannot heave off, he must then endeavor to
lighten the vessel by discharging part of the cargo.

Before heaving off, an examination ought to be made, so as to
ascertain, as near as possible, the extent of the injury which the
vessel has received since aground, if the shore be rocky, that it may
be remedied before heaving off, if possible; if the vessel has run on
with much way, it is possible that she may not float, even if she were
got off. In this case the lives of the passengers and crew become the
first consideration.

=403.=--THE BALLAST SHIFTING AT SEA.

This frequently occasions losses at sea. To prevent its occurrence,
when iron ballast is stowed, let a few oak battens be nailed from the
sides athwart ships, to secure it; or when shingle ballast is used,
place a light flooring over it, secured by a few battens athwart ships.
This would most probably prevent such a calamity, which usually occurs
when a vessel is struck by a heavy sea, or when hove on her beam ends,
and prevents the possibility of her righting again; when the ballast
is stowed, it ought to be secured at the same time from shifting; this
is of great moment, and a few strong battens will do it. Also have
shifting boards amidships, nailed to the stanchions.

=404.=--VESSELS SURPRISED ON OPPOSITE TACKS.

In cases of surprise and danger, from the accidental meeting of two
ships on opposite tacks, in the night, it too often happens that
officers are more apt to give orders to _the stranger_, than to take
any measure of precaution themselves; such as hailing to put the helm
up or down, and to clear them, when they may be as much in fault, and
possess the same means of extricating themselves from the difficulty.
In situations of this sort, it is much better that both parties should
put their _helms down_ rather than _up_; the ships will approach
each other for a time, but will diminish in velocity, and afterwards
separate.

Obstinacy, or a want of judgment in the directing parties, frequently
leads both vessels to bear up at the same instant; consequently
causing immediate collision. It is a universal rule with seamen, that
where there is doubt, the vessel on the _larboard tack_ is to bear up
or to heave about, for the vessel on the _starboard tack_; were this
prudent _regulation_ strictly adhered to, and never violated by the
obstinacy of parties, accidents would seldom occur; but it sometimes
happens that incidental circumstances induce both parties to risk “a
trial of skill,” by one endeavoring to weather the other. In these
cases doubt and hesitation generally prevail, and _disaster_ is sure to
follow.

=405.=--MEETING AT SEA.

[Illustration]

Bend on the ensign and pendant, if a private ship.

Hoist the ensign and pendant, when sufficiently near, if the vessel you
are meeting be a ship of war.

In hailing, the ordinary questions commence thus;

“What ship is that?”

“Whence come you?”

“Where are you bound?” &c., &c.

=406.=--A HINT ON RUNNING TOO LONG.

Vessels ought not to run too long, when the sea is high and breaking,
but bring-to in time, and do so by daylight if possible.

=407.=--A HINT ON ROUNDING-TO IN A GALE.

An experienced seaman remarks, that when he wished to bring-to in a
hard gale, when running before a heavy sea, he always watched for a
heavy sea breaking abaft the main chains, and immediately after, he
eased the helm down, and rounded-to at once, being previously prepared
for doing so. In managing this way, he found he could avoid shipping a
sea.

=408.=--ON MAKING YOUR PORT.

Never run for your port in very heavy gales, or thick weather, unless
sure of the ship’s position.

_Note._--There are some ports, that may be entered with safety at
night by sailing vessels, but there are many more where it cannot be
attempted, without great risk of getting aground, or being wrecked.

I do not know anything to compensate for running that risk, except
an urgent necessity; as, when anchored, nothing can be done until
morning. Lay-to in preference, and carry a light at the main-stay at
night. Gales do not last long, and finer weather follows.

While lying-to in gales, always keep the ship steering with the helm
nearly “amidships,”--_never_ let it be kept “_a lee_,” as the ship
will not be under command without steerage-way, or be safe and easy.

=409.=--LYING OFF, AND ON, TO ENTER A PORT.

I have known so many vessels wrecked while lying-to with a topsail to
the mast, with their head in shore, that I recommend (if it is moderate
weather), to make short tacks, under easy sail, as then the ship’s
place can always be kept worked up; whereas her drift while lying-to is
uncertain. Let the tacks in shore be shorter than the ones off, to give
the coast a good berth. It is better to be a mile further out than to
get aground.

[Illustration]

=410.=--TO ANCHOR AND VEER A LONG SCOPE OF CABLE.

Whenever, and wherever you anchor, veer a long scope of cable _at
once_,--never lay short unless when getting underweigh. No ship
ought to lay at single anchor for more than a few hours. Moor with a
whole cable each way, as soon as possible. All vessels ought to have
_swivels_, and moor with one, to keep a clear hawse.

Bend the sheet-cable, and see the anchor clear for letting go as soon
as you have moored. In the winter, be prepared for striking lower yards
and topmasts, if necessary.

=411.=--PREPARATIONS FOR GOING INTO HARBOR.

The paint work outside should be scrubbed, and, if the weather permit,
freshen up where most wanted--for instance, under the bows. The masts
should be scraped and properly stayed, the tips of studding-sail
booms painted, and the rigging slightly touched with blacking, when
brown or worn. The good order of the ratlines should be attended to,
swinging-boom ladders and pendants got ready, and all the chafing-gear
taken off. The boats’ sails and awnings should be clean and ready for
use, the masts and oars scraped, scrubbed, or painted, as required; the
smokesail clean, also the wind-sails. Clean hammocks may be slung, and
neatly stowed. The cables (including the _sheet_, if it blows hard),
should be bent in plenty of time, &c. &c. The ship’s company clean and
in uniform--the accommodation ladder got ready, and in good order for
shipping when at anchor.

=412.=--CAUTIONS AT NIGHT--(LOOKOUTS).

A good lookout should be kept at night. As soon as it is dark, every
vessel should carry a light under the fore-top; this should be a rule,
and not even left optional. If this light were carried in a lantern
with green glass, the distinguishing light of a sailing vessel would
be known. Steamers on the coast, bays, or harbors, usually carry
wheel-house lights, as well as a mast-head one.

[Illustration: A Sloop-of-War hove to, for a pilot.]

The sea-going steamers mostly carry two horizontal lights--they are
therefore easily distinguished. Sailing vessels on the coast ought
always to have a light kept on deck (in a tub or bucket, for shading
it), ready to be shown, as steamers sometimes come up astern.

A musket loaded with blank cartridge is useful as a signal to call
attention, and should be kept ready at hand.

A vessel on the starboard tack should show a light at the lee-cathead.
A vessel on the larboard tack should show a light on the weather
cathead.

=413.=--WHEN TWO VESSELS ARE IN COLLISION.

If in a tide’s way, and in less than ten fathoms, the headmost one
should anchor either with a stream or bower, as most convenient.

If on _soundings_ from thirty to ten fathoms, the headmost vessel
should drop a kedge-anchor.

If vessels get foul of each other in deep water (should the weather be
sufficiently moderate), get a boat ahead of the headmost and another
astern of the sternmost, and _two_ apart in opposite ways.

If a vessel anchor too close in another’s hawse, the one next ahead of
her should send her a tow-line, with which she might pass a hawser on
board to enable her to warp clear.

=414.=--SQUALLS--(CAUTION).

They usually give some notice by gathering up black in the horizon.
If the darkness rises up and thins away at the bottom, it will not be
strong; but if it still continues thick in the horizon, expect wind.
Shorten sail before it comes. Clouds high, with hard edges, denote dry
and strong winds. A large halo around the moon betokens high wind. Be
guarded when clouds pass overhead--the strength of the wind is then
very often most felt.

=415.=--WATER SPOUTS--(CAUTION).

A water-spout appears like a speaking-trumpet, with the small ends
downwards. (It is said the concussion caused by firing guns is likely
to disperse it.) If one should be near, and likely to break on board,
clew-up and furl all (see the topsail clew-lines are afterwards
belayed) batten the hatches, have scupper clear and pumps ready, and
spar-deck ports out.

=416.=--PRESSURE OF WATER AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS.

If a ship has the flattest part of her bottom lying sixteen feet deep
(which is often the case), the water then presses sixteen times as much
upwards against this flat part, as it does upon any part of the same
ship about the waters’ edge; and so on any other part, according to the
depth. For example, suppose this ship to have four leaks, or plug holes
of equal size, that could be driven out occasionally--the first at one
foot under water, the second at four feet, the third at nine feet, and
the lowest at sixteen feet, in the flat part of her bilge; that hole at
four feet deep would leak or let in as much water again, in the same
time, as that at one foot; and that at nine feet, three times as much;
and that at sixteen feet, four times as much, though it run into the
ship upwards; and so on in proportion to the square root of the height
of the water above the leak or plug hole. Therefore leaks in ships are
more or less dangerous, according to their depth under water.

_Note._--On first springing a leak, it will rush in faster until the
water inside is as high as the place where the leak is; and will pour
in less the higher it gets inside.

=417.=--ON STOPPING LEAKS.

If we reflect on the present mode, so constantly practiced, of
watering, by means of a canvass hose from the shore, through the
salt-water into the boat, we can have little doubt of the retentive
power of canvass. When it can be at all ascertained where a leak is
situated (provided it be not too near the keel, or too much in the
run), if it be in any part where you can bring a sail in contact
with it, so as to cover it, remember that a canvass hose, when once
saturated, becomes _tolerably_ water-tight. If part of a sail of No. 1
canvass be doubled and brought by ropes to cover the leak, though it
may not stop it, there can be no doubt it will materially assist in
reducing it.

This canvass must be well and strongly roped and stitched together,
and it had better not be too large; the smaller it is, (provided the
purpose be answered), the better; as it will be less likely to be torn
away. In placing it, the rope ought to be outwards. This double canvass
may be placed in its position by ropes under the keel or out of the
hawse-hole. A sail might be used for this purpose.

=418.=--EXAMINATION OF CHAIN CABLES.

The cables must be got on deck, pins and bolts driven out of the
shackles, and well cleaned and white leaded; every link sounded with
a hammer by the armorer, and some of the lengths transposed. Splicing
pieces and spare shackles should be remembered at the same time, and
treated in the same way.

_Note._--Wooden pins are frequently used in connecting the shackles,
not being liable to rust, and can always be taken out easy. Hickory
is the best wood to make them of.

=419.=--MINUTE GUNS.

If more than one ship be present, minute guns are not usually fired
by all at the same time, as in a common salute, but one ship follows
another, taking up the firing in succession.

The interval between the firing of each two guns must of course be
determined by the number of guns to be fired, and the time through
which they are to be prolonged--a point which is optional, and
sometimes extended through the day.

[Illustration]

=420.=--HOISTING ON BOARD MONEY OR PLATE.

In hoisting on board money, plate, or other valuables, a buoy and
buoy-rope, corresponding to the depth of water, ought always to be
attached thereto, that in case of anything giving way, or the money or
plate going to the bottom, there may be a ready means of recovery at
hand. For boxes of treasure, strong nets, in place of slings, are most
useful and most safe.

_Note._--Money nets are made like a common wad-net, excepting that
the meshes are made smaller and the stuff larger, say of a two-inch
rope.

[Illustration]

PART VIII.

=421.=--STOWING HAMMOCKS.

Nothing adds more to the smart and favorable appearance of a vessel
of war than a neat stowage of hammocks. The superintendants of this
necessary duty are often at fault, forgetting that negligence in the
performance of this service is seldom permitted to pass unnoticed.

In the stowage of hammocks, the officer should stand on the opposite
side of the deck, a position which will enable him to preserve a
symmetrical line, and guide and direct the stower in his progress
fore and aft the netting; they are also enjoined to be careful that
the hammocks of the men be properly lashed up. Defaulters in this
particular should be reported to the First Lieutenant. Seven turns at
equal distances, is the required number of turns with a hammock-lashing.

_Note._--In piping-down hammocks, the officers are cautioned not to
permit the men to throw them on the deck.

[Illustration: LASHING UP HAMMOCKS.]

=422.=--COCKBILLING YARDS--(_Mourning_).

The most appropriate time for cockbilling yards seems to be daylight,
and dark the most proper time for squaring them again; the day then
looks as if it were issued in and closed with mourning.

At 8, or the hour of hoisting the colors half-mast, sway up the
top-gallant yards, slip the lizard, parrel the yards, and cockbill them
with the others previously reversed.

To allow the lower yards to top up properly, the trusses must be
slacked; and if the topsail sheets are of chain and go with a whip, one
of them must be unshackled from the clew, and to assist the lift in
topping, a burton is required.

To allow the topsail yards to top up properly, they must be hoisted
two feet or so off the caps, the parrels and braces must be slacked,
and paunch mats taken out; if there are jaws on, slack the jaw-rope.
Trysail and spanker gaff should be lowered well down, and swinging
booms dropped into the water.

The way of topping the yards ought to be governed by the side on
which the top-gallant yards are sent up: for instance, if the
main-top-gallant yard be sent up on the starboard side, the main and
main-topsail yards should be topped to port. The squaring them, when
topped, should be done with reference to lower yards; which, in the
first place, are topped as high as the top rims will allow; then being
squared by the braces, the topsail and top-gallant yards have only to
be parallel.

=423.=--DRESSING SHIP WITH FLAGS.

Though in some particulars the following remarks on dressing with
flags refer peculiarly to ships in general, they are applicable to all
classes of vessels; so much so indeed, that but little variation will
be found necessary in applying them to line-of-battle ships, and so on
down to a schooner.

One mode of dressing a ship with flags is to make an arch of them from
the flying-jib-boom to the spanker-boom-end; another is to trice the
flags up by the signal halliards, stopping them out to the yard-arms:
but the best way, perhaps, is to combine these two modes, if there be
flags enough. Hoisted to the trucks ought to be the ensign, jack, or
the flags of the nation in whose port the ship is lying, or whom it
is wished particularly to honor; and to give these room to display
themselves, the rest of the flags should only be triced as high as the
top-gallant mast-head.

[Illustration: Representation of a Ship-of-War, dressed with Flags, and

no numbers affixed are the ship’s signals, or, rather, the telegraphic
numbers.]

If it be determined to combine the two modes of dressing, as mentioned
above, that is, with up and down flags, as well as with an arch, it
will prevent confusion and superabundance, and produce an equally
good effect to have up and down flags at the main only; and to hoist
them, whips or halliards should be placed for the purpose, through the
top-gallant studding-sail halliard blocks, and taken _outside_ the
brace blocks.

The flying-jib halliards will hoist the foremost part of the
arch, viz.: that which extends from the flying-boom-end to the
fore-top-gallant mast-head. To the mizen-top-gallant mast-head it must
be hoisted by a whip placed for the purpose, and hauled out to the
gaff-end by a whip.

From the gaff-end the flags composing the arch drop to the water, being
stopped out to the boom-end, and distended under it, as well as under
the flying-boom, by small hand-leads: there ought also to be downhauls
on the arch; also whips with downhauls between top-gallant mast-heads.
Care and taste are necessary in sorting and placing the flags. The
ensigns should be in corresponding places--for instance at the lower
yard-arms. The square flags should all be together; also cornets,
pendants, &c., or else a square flag and cornet alternately, and so on.

Bad feeling is sometimes occasioned, when foreign ships-of-war are
assembled, by placing national colors injudiciously, in dressing ship.
This ought to be studiously avoided. This fact has given rise to the
practice, on “gala days,” of hoisting nothing but the national flags
at each mast-head, or, if in honor of another nation, the flag of that
nation at the fore.

One principal beauty, however, of the manœuvre in question, is to have
everything so prepared and foreseen, that immediately the yards are
crossed, and decently squared, and the mast-head flags broke, all the
others may be triced up so as to find their places readily and without
confusion, hands previously prepared, laying-out together at the same
time to each yard-arm, stopping the up and down flag-halliards there:
and then at the “word,” laying-in _together_.

At sunset, the best way, perhaps, is to haul the flags down just before
sending down the top-gallant yards.

=424.=--KEEPING THE COPPER CLEAN.

The good or bad condition of the copper on a ship’s bottom above the
water line, has a wonderful effect upon her appearance. If daubed over
with blacking, or otherwise neglected, when possible to attend to it, a
slovenly appearance is communicated to the outside look which a ship of
war ought to be exempt from.

One way of managing is to scrub off all spots, and rub it occasionally
with an oily cloth, when there is leisure; and if this is constantly
attended to, perhaps it is the best and simplest plan, although I have
heard yachts find river mud better.

Another way is to paint it with red ochre and oil, mixed to the color
of new copper. When well and effectually done, this will preserve a
good appearance for a long time; but the finest and calmest weather
must be taken advantage of to lay it on, as the least ripple will wash
all off in its way when wet.

To clean the copper under the water line, seize on to a handy spar of
sufficient length, half-a-dozen strong, coarse deck clamps, and apply
them against the ship’s bottom from a stage, if it can be got; if not,
from the largest boat, previously keeling the ship, by running the guns
in on one side, and out on the other. The copper of a small vessel may
be completely cleaned in this way.

If the copper on the trysail mast, and fore and main-masts of brigs
and schooners be attended to and kept clean, it tends very much to the
appearance of the vessel. The most common obstacle to this is grease,
which generates verdigris excessively, but may be easily prevented by
attention.

=425.=--FURLING FROM A BOWLINE.

The stress of the work here being on the bunt-lines and clew-ropes, but
few hands are required on the topsail clew-lines.

WORDS OF COMMAND.

Call--“All hands furl sails.”

Man the bunt-lines and clew-lines (including the clew-ropes and head
downhauls).

“Aloft, top-men;”--stand by to furl sails.

“Aloft, lower yard-men;”--haul taut--shorten sail--lay-out.

Furl-away, gather up, and pass the gaskets;--lay in off the
yards;--stand by the booms. Down booms--rig them out to the
mark;--square the heels. Square yards, stopping up gear at the same
time. When the yards are squared by the braces, the boatswain ought to
hurry ahead, to square them by the lifts. At the same time haul taut
the bow-lines, jib and staysail-halliards, and see all the clew-lines
close up.

When the yards are squared by the lifts, haul taut topsail and
top-gallant sheets, and reef-tackles, as well as all other slack ropes,
(heels of the studding-sail square, &c. &c.)

_Note._--The topsail and top-gallant sheets and reef-tackles ought
not previously to be hauled taut, because they then interfere with
squaring the yards by the lifts.

[Illustration: Representation of a Frigate, with her Sails loose to
dry.]

_Remarks._--The tacks and sheets are generally kept unrove in
harbor, and the courses hauled up by the clew-ropes one bunt-line
and leech-line of a side; the topsails by the bunt-lines only, led
through a lizard at the clews, or clew jiggers. The hauling down of
the headsails is much facilitated by having the halliards racked
and overhauled at the mast-head, and a hand there ready to cut the
racking, when the word is given to shorten sail.

=426.=--HIGH AND LOW BUNTS.

Low, or rolling bunts, require bunt-gaskets, and are tedious in stowing
and securing snug--high, or French bunts, require no gaskets, but
secure to the topsail-tye by a becket and stopped. Being larger, and
more open abaft, the slack sail is more easily stowed in them than in
low bunts; neither is any time or labor lost about bunt-gaskets, a
circumstance not to be overlooked, in competing with other vessels.

The look is a matter of taste; in general, however, topsail-yards are
thought neatest, with first or second-reefed earings hauled partly out,
but neither reef-points tied, nor bunt-gaskets on; the bunt described
is a French bunt, being secured to the tye by a midship-becket in the
first reef band, and the sail furled in the skin of the first reef and
back-cloths.

_Note._--The proper place for the furling-glutt, is two-thirds of the
depth of first reef.

=427.=--TO CLEAR MAST-HEADS.

Clear mast-heads form a distinguishing mark of a ship-of-war. To make
them so, the eyes of the rigging ought to be carefully placed, boused
down a-midships by the mast, and beat down at the mast-head with a
commander, and the shrouds set up in their places with care. The eyes
of the stays, and the slings of the lower yards, ought also to be sent
down over all, and nothing more should be on the lower mast-heads,
observable to the eye.

Over topmast-heads the ginn-blocks ought to go first, with a
span lashing to the pendants, so as to take them close up to the
trestle-trees; rigging and stays, same as lower mast-heads--standing
parts of ties, through a score in the heel of topgallant-mast, inside
of the trestle-trees, and taken abaft the mast-head and lashed
together close down on top of the stays. It would be well to put a
quarter-seizing on each side, around both stay and tye. This does away
with the not uncommon, but slovenly practice, of hitching the standing
part of the topsail-tye over the rigging, and expending the end, by
heaping it up with five or six turns half-way to the cap.

Opinions are divided as to whether mast-heads painted white, or
black, look the best. This is a matter of taste; but it is a matter
of certainty, that black shades and conceals, while white tends to
display, what a seaman is proud of, the neatness and good order of his
rigging, which should not be concealed by a white canvass mast-coat.

The neatest mast-heads I ever saw were painted white, with the upper
half of the top-rims and lower-half of the caps of the same color;
the lower half of the top rims, and the upper half of the caps, being
black; thus the large space of white was terminated and relieved
above and below, by a neat, small, but distinct line of black. The
topmast cross-trees, topmast-heads, and lower halves of topmast-caps
were also white; upper half of caps black. Topmasts scraped close
up to the cross-trees, the eyes of the topgallant and royal rigging
covered with canvass, in place of service, and painted black--no paint
above topmast-head caps, nor outside of the bowsprit-cap. With clear
mast-heads, ought to be combined neat tops, wherein the ropes are
flemished, and kept low and snug.

=428.=--PLACING BELAYING-CLEATS IN TOPS.

If the belaying-cleats for studding-sail tacks and halliards,
topgallant and royal lifts, and royal sheets, are placed on the
cross-pieces, or carlines of tops, and not on the shrouds or
mast-heads, the rigging there will look much neater.

=429.=--MAKING SWABS.

Old rope, called junk, is unlaid into yarns. Make a grommet with a good
strand; then take some of the yarns of the junk, take the twist or lay
well out, and middle them in the grommet, and continue to fill up (to
the size required), close to the grommet; clap on a good seizing of
spun-yarn, and then, if wished, _snake it_; sometimes the handle, or
grommet, is made by splicing both ends together, the splice laying in
the head of the swab. In making the grommet, the ends of the strands
should not be cut off, but seized-in with the rest of the swab.

=430.=--STOWAGE OF SWABS.

Swabs in the head are an eye-sore; attention should be directed to the
contrivance of some other stow-hole for them, to which they should be
rigorously confined, except when in use.

=431.=--JUNK.

Junk is supplied for the purpose of working up into various uses--such
as into swabs, spun-yarn, knittle-stuff, lacings, seizings, earings,
gaskets, &c., &c.,--all of which the supply in proper kind is generally
inadequate. Good junk is got out of such materials as condemned
cables--they having been necessarily made of the best stuff, and
condemned before being much injured. Old messengers, old rigging, &c.,
make bad junk, not being condemned generally until much worn.

Of the worst junk swabs and spun-yarn should be made; of the best,
knittle and seizing-stuff, lacings, earings, &c. The seizing-stuff is
intended for blocks, ratlines, &c.; the knittle stuff for making mats,
as well as lacings and earings, for studding-sails, boats’ sails, &c.,
and the spun-yarn for fitting and refitting. A surplus stock of all
these ought constantly to be at hand, in store, for the purpose of
refitting or replacing anything that may happen to be carried away,
without loss of time. In order to effect this, the watch on deck, or
part of them, ought to be constantly at work about the junk, when
circumstances permit, drawing, knotting, and balling of yarns, and
assisting the ropemaker in laying up the above mentioned small stuff,
either till the junk is exhausted, or till there is an ample stock on
hand.

Large junk, such as lengths of cables, should be unlaid before being
put below, that it may admit of being snugly stowed.

=432.=--MAKING MATS, AND CHAFING GEAR.

The breadth of mats for lanyards of rigging, is determined by the size
of the dead-eye, which the mat ought nearly to cover; the length by
the distance from the upper to the lower dead-eye. For lacing, small
beckets should be worked in each corner and side. The mats on the
foremost swifters of the lower rigging and backstays, should be longer
than the others, on account of the foot and clew of the courses, when
reefed and hauled aft, grinding against them high up; or shifting mats
for that especial purpose should be kept, to put on at sea and take
off in harbor. Thrum-mats are required for the paunch of lower topsail
and topgallant yards, to prevent chafing. Those that follow are only
required at sea; so that for neatness and economy, they may always be
taken off when going into harbor.

To take the chafe off the rigging, when the lower yards are braced up,
a large square hanging mat is required, thrummed on each side of the
futtock-shrouds. This has a lanyard in each corner, and is clapped on
thereby, with the upper half on the foremost futtock-shrouds, the lower
half on the foremost swifters; the middle part being in a line with the
catharpens.

On each side of the bunts of the courses, before all, a thrum-mat
is requisite, to prevent the head of the sail chafing against the
stay where they come in contact, when the yards are braced up. A
breeches-mat is also required on the stay itself, for the same purpose.
Small, square, neat mats, in the way of leech-lines, on each side, are
also necessary, to prevent chafing.

To prevent the topsail yards, when braced up, from chafing the foremost
shrouds of the topmast rigging, a quarter mat abaft the yards on each
side, is required.

A thrum-mat is necessary on the horn of each foremast cross-tree, to
prevent their wearing holes in the topgallant sails.

For the backstays, in the wake of the lower yards, when braced up, mats
or platting, or some such substitute, is necessary as a protection.
Merchant vessels use _Scotsmen_ [slips of wood so called]; but for
ships of war, I think leather, snugly stitched and kept on in harbor,
as well as at sea, is the best.

In a brig, the boom-mainsail will sometimes have a hole fretted in
it, by chafing against the quarter boat’s stanchions, or the belaying
cleats there; these ought therefore to be protected by mats.

=433.=--GASKETS.

There is a great risk of gaskets marking and spoiling the looks of the
sails, if not thoroughly dried before being used.

The number of sea-gaskets must depend upon the size of the ship; the
smallest, however, such as a schooner or brig, requiring four for each
side of lower yards, and the same for topsail yards. For topgallant and
royal yards, half the number is enough; for boom mainsail, six; for jib
and flying-jib, five each.

Harbor-gaskets answer best with one end tapered and the other worked
with an eye. By reeving and unreeving the tapered end through the eye,
and round the jackstay, they are then easily put on or taken off. Their
length ought to be sufficient for a round turn round the sail and
yard, with enough of end to tack in and secure between the sail and
round turn abaft, or rather, on upper quarter abaft. Their breadth is
a matter of fancy, but broad ones are generally preferred. They should
be carefully placed upon the yards, as nearly as possible, at equal
distances.

_Note._--If any long gaskets are used, half the number is sufficient.

=434.=--SCRAPING AND GREASING MASTS.

When the blacking of the rigging is dry, the masts ought to be scraped
and cleaned, then greased. For the men to stand upon when scraping
the lower masts, rig triangles of capstan bars, with whips to the
mast-heads; for hoisting and lowering, with the topmasts, handspikes
answer instead of capstan bars, and the royal and topgallant masts may
be managed from a bowline in the end of a girt-line, or a span from
shroud to shroud.

To prevent spotting the deck, the deck-cloths ought to be spread, and
some hands kept constantly sweeping up the shavings.

The topgallant and royal yard-arms should not be neglected. The
studding-sail booms, except when new, ought to have the least possible
shaving taken off them by a carpenter, and then varnished. This does
not injure them more than scraping, and keeps them infinitely smoother.

Before laying on the grease, the captains of the tops, &c., should
report that everything is scraped and ready, and the boatswain should
examine.

_Note._--It is customary in some ships first to scrape masts, then
tar down the rigging, and lastly paint; but there is objections to
this, as the men are liable to daub the masts when tarring down, and
they would have to be done over again.

Studding-sail booms should never be greased, as they are liable to
daub the sail.

=435.=--MANNING YARDS.

If previously aware that the yards are to be manned in the course of
the day, clap on life-lines instantly; the topgallant and royal yards
are crossed in the morning, the hands laying out and in together; then
square yards.

Fewer men being required for manning yards than furling sails, those
required for the former may be easily sized and _selected_ from among
the latter, keeping them always on their respective yards--the tallest
outside.

The yard-arm men extend their outside arms straight, holding on by the
studding-sail halliards, whilst they clap their inner arms over the
life-lines, holding it fast under the arm-pit; the next man in the same
way extends his outer arm, and grapples the shoulder of the yard-arm
man; then passes his inner arm over the life-line, clasping it under
his arm-pit, and so on to the bunt.

The appearance of the boat, at whatever distance it may be, is the
customary signal for manning yards; yet it would be at times a
preferable rule to endeavor to judge of the distance, and act so that
the men may not be more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour aloft.

The men on the yards ought to face the boat; that is, when the boat is
abaft the beam, they ought to face aft; when before the beam, forward:
but in a ship, when the commodore[36] ascends the side, the hand on the
cross-jack and mizen-topsail yards ought to face forward--all others as
before, aft.

[36] Or the personage whom it is intended to honor.

=436.=--MAN ROPES--(SIDE).

If side or man-ropes be covered with canvass or baize, the stitches
should be taken through the strands of the rope, to prevent the
covering getting out of its place, and puckering; and to take the chafe
or nip in the wake of the eye-bolt, through which they reeve, a small
bit of leather should be neatly stitched on.

The handsomest and most durable man-ropes are those entirely pointed
over with neat, small line. The job is a tedious one, but worth the
expense and trouble.

=437.=--SPARE DEAD-EYES.

A good plan for spare dead-eyes of rigging is to have them in two
pieces, and with small bolts fixing them together, so that in the event
of carrying one away, it can be easily replaced, without having to take
chain, plate and all to a smiths’ shop.

=438.=--HIDE ROPE.

Where there is much and continued friction, or a short nip, hide rope
is found to have great advantage over hemp; some say thirty per cent.
Thus it is good for wheel-ropes, whip for hatchway, topsail-ties,
trusses, topgallant and royal sheets and yard ropes, parrels,
jib-pendants, lacings, reef-pendants and lashing, studding-sail tacks
and halliards.

For preservation above deck, hide rope should have a coating of two
parts of grease and one of tar; below deck, a coat of neats’ foot oil.
When not wanted, such as wheel-ropes in harbor, it should be kept under
cover.

_Note._--Hide rope is now allowed by regulation for tailing all
sheets, also for ties, truss, pendants, &c., &c. (_See rigging
table._)

=439.=--HAWSE-HOLE WINDSAIL.

A windsail to carry the great draught of the hawse-holes down into the
holds, &c., is a very useful thing, though not common.

=440.=--FIGHTING-LADDERS.

Some ships have fighting ladders of rope always set up, ready, and the
wooden ones for common use placed against them.

_Note._--Iron Jacob’s-ladders fitted amidships in hatchways are very
useful in the morning when washing decks, or at quarters, when the
wooden ladders are unshipped.

=441.=--HAWSE BUCKLERS.

Bucklers are of two sorts; half-bucklers, shipped when the cables are
bent, and blind-bucklers when they are unbent. The object of the first
is to prevent shipping water through the hawse-holes, while the cables
are bent, and are put on, after filling with shakings the hawse-hole
through which the cable runs; they are secured by upright, iron bars,
slipping on and off upon grooves above and below.

Blind-bucklers are put on after a plug (called hawse-plug, of the size
of the hawse-hole) has been thrust in. They are secured the same way as
the half-bucklers.

When the cables are ordered to be clear for running, the half-bucklers
should be unshipped.

_Note._--Half-bucklers are made with a score to fit the cable.

=442.=--MAKING FAST A WARP TO A VESSEL.

The best place for making a warp fast to, is the bitts, after passing
through the spare hawse-hole: _there_ it will not interfere with the
side or paint work; is perfectly clear, quite secure, and ready to let
go in an instant. If made fast to the cables, which is next best, it is
more difficult to let go.

=443.=--FITTING QUARTER BOATS’ GRIPES.

Boats’ gripes are made with spun-yarn or small rope, as a sword-mat:
one end is secured round the davit-head, the other, when the boat is
up, passed under her bottom, and secured in the _chains_ with a lashing.

=444.=--FITTING GIGS’ SLINGS.

Gigs’ slings are made as sword mats. When sufficient is made to take
the boat’s bottom and clear the gunwales, the spun-yarn, or rope
between each part, is fitted as a stopper or selvagee, parceled and
served over, and a thimble seized in the bight, which the tackles hook
to. The stretches, made of wood, are put between both parts of the
slings, long enough to keep them two or three inches off the gunwale.

For the span, measure the length from the after ring-bolts to the
slings; when in their place, leave six inches for splicing, and cut the
rope; measure from the after-slings to the fore ones, leaving about six
inches and cut; measure from the fore-slings to the ring-bolt in the
stern and cut; splice a hook and thimble in the ends, the other ends
splice together, forming two cut splices, large enough to go over the
thimbles in the slings, and seize them in their place.

_Note._--Some prefer artificial eyes worked in the ends of the
slings, to go over the end of the stretcher; this is not so safe.

=445.=--SCRUBBING A BOAT’S BOTTOM, ON LEAVING HARBOR.

It frequently happens in preparing for sea, a large boat’s bottom,
such as a launch, or any other boom boat, requires cleaning, and there
happens to be no place at hand to haul her up on shore, in preference
to hoisting her up and doing it aboard, and causing a great _muss_ on
deck; hoist her out of the water by the cat, and another tackle to the
bowsprit, and scrub her bottom from another boat (or catamaran).

=446.=--CARRYING LIGHT BOATS ON LAND.

The best way to cary a boat, is to upset her, and let the men, with
their jackets on their shoulders, (or some such protection against the
sharp pressure of the gunwale,) stand under and take the gunwales on
each side on their shoulders; some hands may also be advantageously
placed in amidships under the thwarts.

[Illustration]

=447.=--MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON WORKING BOATS.

[Illustration]

If a boat be crank, or if it be wished in working to windward to
accelerate speed, all hands should sit down in the bottom of the boat.
If in haste, working to windward, pull the weather oars.

A boat with only one sail, such as a lug, should never attempt beating
to windward, except when necessary to give the crew a spell.

Let no one ever sit on the gunwale, but accustom the crew to sit in
their places, and to make and shorten sail without stirring from their
seats. Besides the due execution of this manœuvre, the safety of the
boat is much implicated in the degree of attention paid to this rule.

In taking in a lug sail, lower the halliards and haul down on the
weather-leach.

_Note._--Keep boats out of the water as much as possible.

[Illustration]

=448.=--DUTIES OF BOATS’ CREWS.

[Illustration: A SHIP OF WAR’S LAUNCH.]

Nothing sooner indicates the order and discipline of a vessel of war,
than the clean state and efficient condition of the boats, together
with the personal appearance of their crews. In this particular,
sufficient care is not always observed in the service; in well
regulated ships, the coxswains are compelled to report to the senior
lieutenant the state of their respective boats, and in the morning to
ascertain from the officer of the boat, the manner he may require the
crews to be dressed for the day &c., &c.

=449.=--BOATS GOING ON DISTANT SERVICE.

Memoranda of articles required for distant service--viz.: spyglass,
compass, pencil and paper, chart, watch, lead and line, tinder-box,
grapnel and rope, stern-fast, hammer, nails, spike for guns, spare
rope, (size of boat’s gear,) spare tiller, spare oars, blue-lights,
lanterns and candles, casks or kegs for water, arm-chest, flints,
turn-screw, towing-nets, pea-coats, muffling for oars, fishing-lines,
iron pot, fuel, each man a knife, an axe, a maul, a crowbar, needles,
twine, colors, rations for the boat’s crew at discretion.

=450.=--BOATS UNDER SAIL.

[Illustration: A SHIP OF WAR’S CUTTER.]

Care should be taken that the halliards be coiled up clear for running,
that the sheets be not belayed, and that the crew, in shortening sail
to a squall, do not shift their seats, or, as is too common a custom,
stand upon the thwarts to gather in the shaking sail; in lowering a
lug, or lateen sail, haul down alone on the luff, (the fore-leech;) the
after one better be left untouched.

Coxswains should also be cautioned of the danger of letting go the
helm. This is often inadvertently done wrong--sometimes to secure the
heel of the bumkin, or to get a pull of the main or mizen-sheet. By
this thoughtless practice, boats are liable to fly up in the wind, the
sails to be taken aback, be difficult to lower, and eventually to cant
over and capsize to windward.

=451.=--GIVING A ROPE TO A BOAT.

When a boat from a lee-tide, or running-sea, requires from the ship the
aid of a rope, care must be taken that the tow-line be passed as far
forward as possible. The position of the fore-channels is too far aft,
and causes too short a scope. The tow-line should be passed from the
cat-head, with a slip-rope to the crown of the spare or sheet-anchor,
which, if slacked when the bowman secures the tow-line, the boat will
ride with a good scope, and with comparative ease.

_Caution._--The tow-line should never be made fast to the ring in
the bow of the boat; it should be passed through the ring by way of
a fair-leader, and eventually secured to the bottom of the boat or
thwart.

_Mooring boats._--Boats are best moored at the guess-swarp-boom. In
this position they ride under the eye of the officer of the deck, and
are less liable to be damaged than when secured alongside, or moored
astern.

Boat-keepers, unless especially called to assist in the execution of
urgent or heavy service, should never be permitted to leave their
boats.

=452.=--CROSSING A BAR WITH SURF, IN BOATS.

As a boat will not rise over surf as over an unbroken wave, but on the
contrary, the surf boils over and into the boat, the less surface there
is presented, and the higher it is out of the water, the better. For
this reason a boat ought to be kept stem on, or right before it, when
the heaviest waves approach, waiting till they are past, to pursue her
way edgeways across the bar.

_Stem on_ is the safest, the smallest surface and the strongest and
highest part of the boat being in that way presented to the surf,
while the rudder and oars possess sufficient power to maintain the
position assumed. Right before it has the disadvantage of lowness of
stern, which makes pooping more likely than taking water over the
bows--protracted exposure to the wave, (for you must go along with it,)
and the tendency to gripe and broach-to, which from the rudder being
lifted and left out of the water, and rendered useless as soon as the
broken wave passes it, is often irresistible and fatal, and can only
be counteracted by the skill and steadiness of the crew, in steering
the boat by their oars until the rudder comes again into play. If a
boat broaches-to in these circumstances, she will most likely fill, and
instantly upset, in which case, I believe the best plan is to cling to
the boat (or some of her gear), and endeavor to right her again, if
possible.

=453.=--HAULING UP BOATS.

A gig’s crew may haul up their boat, but for all other boats, it
requires at least double the number of their crews, assisted by rollers
and tackles.

A line-of-battle-ship’s launch may be hauled up by five-and-forty
hands, in the following manner: run her bow on to the beach, and let a
few hands on each quarter keep her in that position, by setting their
oars against the ground; next sweep her with a hawser, and guy it up at
the stern to a proper height by several turns of the painter; to this
hawser hook on the double block of a long tackle, the other end, or
single block being overhauled to a proper length, and made fast as most
convenient.

Pass the bight of another hawser round the stern post, and having guyed
it up on each side to the main thwart, there hook on, on each side, a
quarter tackle also, overhauled to a proper length, and hooked on at
the other end, as most convenient; man these with the remaining hands:
then having placed rollers in succession to take the boat’s fore-foot
and keel, proceed to haul away. When up, the loose thwarts set against
the ground and wash streak will keep her upright. Smaller boats do
not require quarter tackles; a few hands on the quarters to keep them
upright, answer the purpose. Heavy boats especially should not be
turned bottom up, it strains them so much. The loose thwarts might be
placed for the rollers to roll on, if the ground is soft.

=454.=--LOWERING BOATS.

On lowering boats from the quarter or stern, care must be taken
that the moment the boat touches the water, the _after_ tackles be
quickly unhooked from the slings or ring bolts. If in a tide’s way
the precaution be not observed, the probability is, the boat will
immediately fill, and the men in the boat be exposed to imminent peril.

=455.=--TURNING UP THE HANDS.

In calling up the hands, or calling the crew to the performance of
their duties, the boatswain too often indulges in piercing pipes,
and drawling tones of superfluous length. Boatswains have a singular
propensity to demonstrate the soundness of their lungs, by an endless
protraction of a note on their piercing pipes. They should not be
so fond of supplying the place of sea birds. This is not the worst
feature in their taste; for when at last they utter the required
summons, they give it forth in tones so drawling, that the first words
are often forgotten before the last are out.

_Note._--A-l-l h-a-n-d-s a-b-o-u-t-s-h-i-p.--This lengthy summons,
and a longer-winded whistle, and each pipe and phrase three times
repeated by the boatswain and his mates, the ship may be ashore
before the leader of the band is convinced how _dearly he has paid
for his whistle_.

=456.=--INSPECTION OF RIGGING--MORNING AND EVENING.

In the morning the boatswain will be required to inspect as early as
possible the state and condition of the standing and running rigging,
and to report the result of his examination to the officer of the
morning watch. He should be particularly careful to see that the
ratlines of the rigging are properly secure; that the topsail sheet
service is not chafed, and that all the quarter and paunch mats are
properly placed.

_Evening._--The boatswain should inspect at evening quarters all the
rigging, stoppers and necessary gear required upon the occasion of
clearing for action; so that in the event of being surprised by an
enemy at night, such gear may be placed at hand for immediate use.
He should also see that the toggles fitted to the lower and topsail
braces, be securely seized to their respective parts.

=457.=--INSPECTION OF STOWED ANCHORS--(AT SEA)

In boisterous weather, and particularly if the ship be laboring or
lurching heavily, the boatswain should inspect the several anchors, and
see that they are securely stowed. In small vessels, where anchors,
in a heavy sea, are constantly buried under water, it is necessary to
take the precaution of passing preventer stocks and shank lashings. The
quarter boats should also be inspected, and the boatswain should report
to the officer of the watch the result of such inspection.

=458.=--INSPECTION OF BOATS--(AT SEA).

Every evening after sunset, the boatswain will be required to inspect
the boats on the booms, to see that they be perfectly clear, and that
their sling-spans be severally hooked for hoisting out. In tropical
climates it is strongly recommended to uncover the boats after the sun
has set, in order that they may benefit by the dew and air. Each cover
should be made up and placed in the bow of the boat.

=459.=--GAMMONING THE BOWSPRIT.

The better way to gammon the bowsprit in a large ship, is to get a
caulker’s stage under the bows, fore and aft, under the bowsprit;
secure one end snug to the stern, then get a stout tackle from the
extreme end of the bowsprit; overhaul down and sling the outer end of
the stage; hook on your tackle to the slings, lead your fall down on
the stage; send the men down, and bouse well taut, so as to get the
weight of the stage as much as possible on the bowsprit. Now your stage
being secured, you can proceed to gammon your bowsprit.

Get two stout luff-tackles on the stage and voil block; then get a span
around the inner end of the stage to hook your voil block to; having
your voil hooked, clinch your gammoning round your bowsprit with a
running clinch or a running eye; jam your turn well round the bowsprit,
then reeve down through the gammoning hole up over the bowsprit, then
pass your end down through the scuttle on to the stage; reeve it
through the voil blocks on the stage; clap on your luffs, and bouse
away, leading your fall fore and aft the stage.

_Note._--Leading your fall in this way has a tendency to lift up
the inner end of the stage, and of course your pulling down, and
the weight of the stage on the gammoning, must certainly bring the
bowsprit snug down in its bed, and set your gammoning up very taut.
Having got your first turn taut, rack it well; pass another, and so
on until you fill up your gammoning hole, jamming your last turn
under all parts of the gammoning on the opposite side of the bowsprit
from the way you have passed your gammoning.

When you are setting up your gammoning, two men ought to attend with
commanders, to beat it solid round the bowsprit.

When they are setting up, some people use a great deal of tar and
slush on gammoning, but the less the better. A piece of good leather
under your gammoning is much better than tarred parceling; and when
your gammoning is passed, turn your leather over aft and nail it
down to the bowsprit. Your gammoning ought to be strapped with large
strands in the room of rope, it being much softer and better to the
gammoning, and all well covered to protect it from the weather. If
you use parceling, let it be dry and new, with a coat of tar over all
when completed.

=460.=--PRECAUTION IN REEVING RUNNING-RIGGING.

In reeving running-rigging, the boatswain is recommended not to cut and
reeve, but on the contrary, to reeve and cut.

However correct the rigging list may appear, there will be always found
a difference of a few fathoms in rope; and it so happens that the
difference is _invariably_ on the wrong side, the allowance being said
to be shorter than the measurement per rope.

_Note._--It were much to be desired that the running-rigging,
previous to reeving, should be stretched to the capstan. The old
practice of taking the end through the coil will in some measure
relieve the rope of many of its kinks, but taking the mere turns
out of a rope is not sufficient to facilitate its run through the
blocks. Such ropes as topsail-sheets, topgallant-sheets and braces,
and jib and staysail-halliards, should be all stretched before they
are rove in their respective blocks. Moreover, if there be any time
more than another that a vessel will require her ropes to run freely,
it is upon the occasion of her first leaving port, with a green and
undisciplined crew.

=461.=--TOPSAIL TYES.

Topsail tyes are now rove in some ships sufficiently long to send the
yards down with, and when not wanted for that purpose, the surplus ends
pertaining to the standing parts secured to the mast-head.

In some ships a strop and thimble are fitted under the rigging,
or a score cut in the heel of the topgallant-mast for the purpose
of reeving through the standing part of the tye, which is secured
breeching-fashion with two strong seizings, and then stopped down the
topmast rigging.

In shifting yards, this method will be found to save much time and
trouble; the surplus end will also answer to sling the topsail-yard
with, when going into action.

=462.=--PRECAUTION IN BLACKING THE RIGGING.

In blacking the rigging, the first precaution that should be taken by
the boatswain, is to cover with old canvass, or hammocks, the lower
mast-heads, and particularly the caps. The blacking should be put on
hot. Thin tar, with a certain portion of lamp-black, hot salt-water,
whisky, and a little litharge mixed together, make an admirable mixture
for blacking the rigging.

It is not recommended to blacken the royal and topgallant rigging
aloft; this rigging may be previously blackened and triced up to dry.

=463.=--FORE AND MAIN BUNTLINES.

The buntlines of the courses are frequently found to jam aloft,
and when rove on the bight, and led forward, constantly to become
cable-laid. Buntlines will be found to lead fairer, and to haul the
sails higher up, by fitting them after the following method.

In the fore part of the top between the trestle-trees, cut two holes;
into these holes insert leaden pipes, backstay-fall fashion; hook to
the foremost bolt, on each side of the lower cap, a block, through
which each buntline-leg is to be rove; take each through the holes cut
in the top, and pass them down before all, and toggle them to the foot
of the sail, the hauling part to lead aft through the lubber’s hole,
and a block turned in at a proper distance, to allow the after leg to
act the part of a pendant.

Through this block a whip purchase is rove; by this method the
buntlines will be always kept clear, and they will be found, on letting
go the whips, to overhaul themselves. In port, when the ship is moored,
the buntline-blocks, with the ropes rove, may be unhooked from the
bolts in the cap, and placed in the top, immediately over the holes
through which the foremost legs are rove in, and can be hooked in a
moment, when wanted.

=464.=--TOPGALLANT MAST ROPES.

For expedition the mast-rope rove upon the bight, with lizards taken
through the royal sheave, must be preferred to the old method of
fidding masts, by the double operation of two mast ropes, namely the
long and the short. If delay is desired, or in other words, people
prefer going the longest way to work, the short mast-rope must be put
in requisition. The mast rope, however, rove upon the bight with
lizards, is better calculated for harbor practice than for sea service.
The mast rope which is here recommended is applicable to every purpose,
may be fitted as follows: The rope is rove as usual, stopped to the
topgallant mast-head, and royal sheave-hole, leaving a long end over
the upper stop to hitch to the bolt in the cap before cutting the stops.

To prevent the ropes from slipping, rack both parts together above the
sheave-hole in the heel of the mast.

=465.=--FUTTOCK SHROUDS.

In all vessels of war, futtock shrouds are too long. Ships whose lower
yards are slung high, and braced sharply up, have their futtock shrouds
considerably shorter than the established length.

=466.=--TOPS AND HALF TOPS.

Many seamen affect to disapprove of half tops, asserting that two
halves can never be so well secured as the whole. This is mere
prejudice; for practical purposes a half top must be always preferred,
especially in large ships.

=467.=--STRIKING OR HOUSING TOPMASTS.

The absence of forethought, or a little practical precaution on the
part of the boatswain and petty officers, is sometimes the cause of
this operation being one of no little labor. When the hands are turned
up, strike topmasts. The lanyards of the after rigging, back-stays
and topmast-rigging should be severally slacked, whilst the jib-stay,
fore-topmast-staysail-halliards, topsail-halliards, topsail lifts,
reef-tackles and topgallant-sheets ought to be well overhauled. Steady
hands should be placed to attend the spring and standing-stays.

When blowing hard, head-to-wind, topmasts constantly bend in the cap,
from the circumstance of letting go and overhauling too much of the
stays.

Should there be any unusual strain on the top-tackle-pendants, it is
well to “stand-fast” the falls for a few seconds, in order that the
people aloft may examine the vicinity of the trestle-trees; and the
mast may produce sufficient strain to carry away the top-tackle-falls,
if not the pendants. This precaution is most particularly directed
during periods of striking topmasts in the dark.

When the masts are struck, they should be kept on the right slue, and
their heels securely lashed, in the event of the ship parting, or it
becomes necessary to set close-reefed-topsails, with the mast down.
The practice of sheep-shanking back-stays is not recommended; the
back-stays may be set up through the medium of good luff-tackles, and
by such means the mast may be rendered sufficiently secure to support
the strain of a close-reefed-topsail.

=468.=--SWAYING UP TOPMASTS.

In performing this heavy operation, every care should be taken to
overhaul well, and to see that such of the standing and running-rigging
are perfectly clear, which are calculated to impede the ascent of the
masts.

The topsail-lifts, topsail-tyes, reef-tackles, jib and
staysail-halliards should be well overhauled below and aloft, and
the lanyards of the topmast-rigging and back-stays be got ready for
setting up, the moment the mast is fidded and stayed. The forecastle
men should have luffs led along the bowsprit, and tackles up and down
the foremast ready for staying the fore and main-topmasts. No topmast
should be fidded by a single top-tackle-pendant. It is true that
small vessels are not allowed a second pendant, but such ships should
reeve a hawser through the dead sheave for the purpose of acting the
part of a preventer, in the event of the top-tackle-fall parting. The
same precaution should be taken with respect to the position of the
cross-trees overhead as has been already mentioned under the head of
rigging topmasts.

_Note._--Such ships should be prepared with stoppers, with two tails
and a toggle, so as to clap on the top-tackle-pendants about a foot
abaft, and under the top-block hooked to the cap.

Topmasts ascend comparatively easy until the fid-hole comes within
six inches of the trestle-trees; then a heavy strain is brought upon
the pendants, particularly upon the falls.

=469.=--UNMOORING.

It frequently occurs in unmooring vessels of war that the veering-cable
is not sufficiently veered. In weighing the first anchor, a
considerable strain has been felt at the capstan, in consequence of
the ship not being permitted to bring the cable up and down. It is
recommended to veer three or four fathoms after the cable is said to
be up and down. This can do no harm; it will put the whole strain of
the ship on the anchor; that is, in weighing, and thereby facilitate
tripping it.

=470.=--REEF LINES TO THE TOPSAILS.

Few ships in the service are fitted with these lines. In some ships
they are attached. In reefing topsails, when blowing fresh and
particularly when steering a course, or going large, reef-lines assist
materially to spill the sail and enable the men on the yards to get
hold of the points, which are difficult to reach when the canvass is
bellying to the breeze.

Reef-lines are thus fitted:--Take a piece of small rope, splice one
end into an eyelet-hole in the head of the sail, seize it around the
neck of one of the first reef-points, on the foreside of the sail, in
a straight line with the eyelet-hole, leaving enough slack to prevent
the sail girting; then seize it under to the second, then the third
reef; splice an eye in the end and seize it to the neck of a close-reef
point. In large ships there should be three reef-lines on each
yard-arm; in small vessels two will be sufficient.

=471.=--REEFING COURSES.

To execute this service with security as well as with celerity, the
reef-earings should be formed of rope sufficiently strong to bear being
boused out by the boom-jiggers; by this method the inner turns of small
rope may be passed with facility.

The outer earing should be led through a block or cheek, fitted for the
purpose; this earing, it must be remembered, is not to be considered as
a substitute for the reef-pendant; it should also be hooked and hauled
out by a separate tackle. It is the general custom now, to fit all
reef-earings on the bight, and pass on both ends.

=472.=-- TOPGALLANT-MASTS STRUCK.

When topgallant-masts are struck, care should be taken that a small
mat be placed between the topmast and the heel of the topgallant-mast;
proper heel lashings should also be fitted for the purpose of securing
the latter.

=473.=--HAILING ALOFT.

Hailing aloft, in well regulated ships, is much repressed by the
boatswain; for bluster is a general indication of but little work, or
the truth of the adage, “_All noise and no work._”

=474.=--PROPORTIONS FOR CABLES--(_Hemp_).

The sheet and bower-cable, one inch in circumference for every two feet
of beam. The stream-cable and messenger, two-thirds of the sheet or
bower chain-cables, which are used for bowers; an allowance is made of
one eighth of an inch for the diameter of the wire of the links, for
every inch of circumference of the hemp-cables. The same rule applies
in all cases where iron rigging is substituted for hemp.

_Note._--Cable-yarns are spun two-fifths longer than the cable for
which they are intended. The yarns for one hundred and twenty fathoms
of cable, must be two hundred fathoms long; for a shroud-laid rope
the yarns are one-third longer--_i. e._, ninety for sixty fathoms.
(_See table of cables._)

=475.=--PROPORTIONS FOR ANCHORS.

For the sheet and bower-anchors, take two-thirds the number of feet
which the ship draws with all her stores, &c., on board, and add it to
the breadth of beam, allowing one hundred-weight for every foot. The
stream-anchor one third of the sheet or bower.

For ships smaller than frigates, an allowance of five hundred
weight for every hundred tons burthen, should be made for sheet and
bower-anchors.

In stocking an anchor, add together the length of the shank, and half
the round of the ring, for the length of the stock. The stock is as
many inches in thickness in the middle, as the shank is long in feet,
and is tapered to half the size at the end. In puddening an anchor
ring, cut the lengths three times the round of the ring.

_Note._--This anchor is for hemp-cables; if for chain-cables, the
length of shank may be reduced one fourth, but not in weight. (_See
allowance table._)

=476.=--WHAT LENGTH IS NECESSARY TO FORM A CLINCH.

In bending cables, the length of rope necessary to form a clinch, is
equal to the length of the shank of the anchor.

=477.=--REFERENCES TO SKETCH OF TEMPORARY RUDDER.

[Illustration: Representation of a Temporary Rudder.]

A. A piece of oak fitted with iron pintles, before launching or while
in dock, and supplied to the ship when going to sea;

B. A piece for the back, and provided for the same;

C. A spare topmast, cut off clear of the sheave-hole; a jib-boom might
do, of the _new regulation_.

D. Iron bolts;

E. Chocks;

F. Iron-pig ballast (if necessary);

G. Eye-bolt in quarter-deck beam, to be put in when required;

H. Rope-guys (through the heel-chock E), to assist in hanging the
rudder. (_See sketch of temporary rudder._)

=478.=--TO SPLICE AN OLD CABLE TO A NEW ONE.

Take the old one to a rope-walk, unlay the strands, and splice them to
the strands of the new one with long splices, after which lay up the
latter. It can be done in another way, but it requires a good and neat
_marlingspike-sailor_ to do it.

=479.=--STRIP SHIP

Begin aloft, and go down regularly, sending down by a reverse
operation. Commence with the topgallant and royal-rigging, and
rig in the flying-jib-boom: next send down topsail and lower
yards, topmast-caps; unrig the topmasts, get in the jib-boom and
spritsail-yards; get off lower caps, tops and rigging; unrig the
bowsprit, and unrig all gaffs, booms and davits.

_Note._--Tally and strop-up rigging as fast as unrove and sent down.

=480.=--PROPORTIONS OF SPARS FOR MERCHANT SHIPS, LENGTH OF SPARS, &c.,
&c.

Main-mast equal to two-and-a-half times the ship’s beam.

Fore-mast equal to eight-ninths the main-mast.

Mizen-mast equal to five-sixths of the main-mast.

Bowsprit two-thirds of the main-mast, one-third of which ought to be
in-board.

Main-topmast three-fifths of the main-mast.

Main-topgallant-mast one-half of the main-topmast, exclusive of the
pole, which is generally one-half the length of the top-gallant-mast or
a little longer.

Fore-topmast three-fifths of the foremast.

Fore-topgallant-mast one-half the length of the fore-topmast, exclusive
of the pole, which is half the length of the topgallant mast.

Mizen-topmast three-fifths of the mizen-mast.

Mizen-topgallant-mast one-half the length of the mizen-topmast, and the
pole one half the length of the topgallant-mast.

Jib-boom the length of the bowsprit, two-thirds of which length is
rigged without the bowsprit-cap.

Main-yard twice the ship’s extreme breadth.

Main-topsail-yard two-thirds of main-yard.

Main-topgallant-yard two-thirds of main-topsail-yard.

Fore-yard seven-eighths of main-yard.

Fore-topsail-yard two-thirds of fore-yard.

Fore-topgallant-yard two-thirds of the fore-topsail-yard.

Royal-yards two-thirds the length of the respective topgallant yards.

Cross-jack-yard same length of main-topsail-yard.

Mizen-topsail-yards the same length of the main-topgallant-yard.

Mizen-topgallant-yard two-thirds of mizen-topsail-yard.

Spritsail-yards five-sixths of the fore-topsail-yard.

_Remark._--Some have the spritsail-yard the length of the
fore-topsail-yard, or nearly so; if it should be much shorter, the
jib-sheets will chafe against the spritsail-braces.

Spanker boom the length of the main-topsail-yard; it is however
made sometimes longer, and sometimes shorter, according to
fancy. Mizen-gaff two-thirds of the spanker-boom--liable to the
same variation. Topsail yard-arms to be long enough to haul out
close-reef-earing.

=481.=--THICKNESS OF SPARS--MASTS.

It has been customary to allow for every three feet of the main-mast’s
length, one inch of the diameter in the partners; nine-tenths of an
inch in diameter in the middle, between the partners and the extremity
of the head, and two-thirds under the hounds, and all other masts in
the same proportion; and with these proportions masts have been usually
made: I am however of opinion that one-quarter of an inch to the foot
is much better.

=482.=--YARDS.

For every four feet of their length, allow one inch of diameter in the
slings, and half that diameter within the squares at the yard-arm.

=483.=--DISTANCE FOR PLACING LOWER MASTS, _in vessels of two masts_.

Foremasts one-seventh the length of spar-deck from forward. Main two
and five-sevenths as far from the foremast.

_Note._--The above rule is not to be considered proper for all
vessels; their places must be governed by the form of the vessel.

=484.=--RULE FOR PLACING MASTS IN A SHIP.

Take the ship’s length from the after part of the stem to the fore part
of the stern-post, and divide it into sevenths. Place the foremast
one-seventh of this length from the stem, the main-mast three-sevenths
from the fore-mast, the mizen and stern-post. This rule is for a
full-built ship; it must therefore be varied when applied to vessels
that are sharp, and the stem and stern posts of which rake; the
foremast must accordingly be placed farther aft, the mizen-mast farther
forward, and the distance between the masts proportionably regulated.

=485.=--RAISING SHEARS ON A WHARF.

The following sketch will show the plan of raising a pair of shears on
_a dock, or wharf_, the shears being 91 feet in length, and 29 inches
in diameter, and connected together at the top by heavy trestle-trees.
They are used for masting ships, and raising heavy boilers of
steam-vessels, &c.

[Illustration]

=486.=--TO FIND THE TONNAGE OF A VESSEL, BY THE UNITED STATES’
MEASUREMENT.

The length is taken from the fore part of the main stern, to the after
part of the stern-post. The beam is measured at the extreme breadth
to the outside of the bends; three-fifths this beam is taken off the
length, before the calculation is made. For a double-decked vessel,
half the breadth of beam, is called the depth of hold, and for a
single-deck it is the same, except that the hold is measured at the
fore part of the hatchway, from the deck down to the ceiling alongside
the keelson.

To proceed on in this calculation, after all the allowances have been
made, the length must be multiplied by the breadth, and the product
by the depth of the hold; then divide the last product by 95, and the
quotient will give the tonnage required.

Formerly the British divided by 94, both for merchant vessels, and
ships of war; but I have been informed they now divide by 100, which is
the reason that they make our ships’ tonnage less than we do.

_Notes on the tonnage of a vessel._--The ship-carpenters’ tonnage in
Philadelphia differs from the United States’ measurement.

A rule staff is laid under the keel, projecting; a line is plumbed
from the upper part of the stern to the rule staff; the keel is
measured from its after part to the plumb line, and including the
rule staff, this is called the length of keel straight rabbit. The
beam is measured from skin to skin, on the inside; three-fifths of
the beam is taken off the keel straight rabbit, for the length, and
the calculation, in other respects, is the same as in the United
States’ measurement; so that the carpenters’ tonnage in Philadelphia
will be less, according to the rake of the stern-post, &c.

The dead rise of a vessel is found by having a staff half the beam
from skin to skin, at the extreme breadth, which staff is laid even
across on the ceiling of the fore part of the main hatchway. One
of the timber boards being taken up, a line is let fall from the
staff to the skin alongside the keelson, and what it measures is the
vessels dead rise; so that in order to know how sharp a vessel is, it
is customary to ask how much dead-rise she has.

=487.=--STEPPING AND RAKING LOWER MASTS.

Foremasts of all ships should be stepped plumb, or perpendicular, to a
water-line. All mainmasts should rake one inch to every four feet above
deck, and all mizen-masts should rake one inch to every three feet
above deck. All bowsprits should be stepped in a direct line, drawn
from the step of the mainmast to the lower part of the bowsprit bed;
this line answers for the lower part of the bowsprit.

It has been the opinion of many sea-officers, that a mast, by raking,
will aid a ship in sailing; but it has been satisfactorily proved, that
it has the contrary effect: for instance, a ship that has her masts
perpendicular only, has to bear them in two positions; the one on the
step, and the other on the side of support; her yards hang free, brace
easy, and bear no strain against them; whereas a ship with her masts
raking, has to bear them in three positions--the one on the step, one
on the side of support, and the other, which is very great, on the fore
and aft stays; her yards also hang very heavy against the mast, which
adds also to the fore support. This must cause a great check in the
progressive movements in the ship. A sharp vessel or ship, with a lean
harping, by raking her masts, frequently eases her in pitching, but
never adds to her sailing, the wind having less power on her sails, and
the principal reason why a ship’s main and mizen masts, should rake a
little from her foremast is, that by separating the masts in this way,
the wind has a better chance of effecting its full power on all the
sails, and of striking that part of them, which otherwise would be of
little or no advantage to the ship.

=488.=--MOORING.

It has been argued and proved, that if ships have room to lay at single
anchor with chain-cables, they are more safe than when moored. The
following example is given as an illustration.

Let A be moored with 75 fathoms S. E. and N. W. and B be at single
anchor, with the same scope of chain; a gale commences from the S. W.;
the strain on each of A’s cables is double the strain on B’s.

It blows harder, and B lets go her other bower, and veers 150 fathoms
on the first, and 75 on the second cable. A also veers 150 fathoms on
both cables, but B still keeps her advantage, the strain being only as
88 to 100; it is clear, therefore, that if either ship parts her cable,
it must be A that will part first.

If A had her mooring swivel on, she could not veer with any advantage,
as the strain on that part of the cable between the swivel and anchor
must remain constant; for this reason, it is obvious that moorings
should _not_ be laid down across the prevailing winds.

The above may be shown practically by stretching a small line between
two points, and suspending a weight in the middle; see what weight it
will bear, and afterwards try what the same line will bear vertically;
the latter will be the ship at single anchor, the former the one moored.

[Illustration: Representation of a Frigate, hove down to a dock or
Wharf.]

PART IX.

=489.=--PREPARATIONS FOR HEAVING DOWN.

CLEARING THE SHIP.

The ship should be stripped to lower-masts and lower-rigging,
cleared of everything excepting the spars and running-gear, which
will be required for lashings; top and gear-tackles, runners, luffs,
pendant-tackles, and in fact all the tackles of every size. The
hammock-nettings should be taken off, the loose bulk-heads removed, and
everything that is not applicable to the operation to be performed, as
it is desirable to have the ship as light as possible. The lower yards
should be kept aloft till the outriggers are placed.

CHOICE AND POSITION OF THE OUTRIGGERS AND SHORES.

If left to your own resources, and large, rough spars are not to be
obtained, the following may be used for outriggers, three of which will
be required for each mast; _i. e._, fore and main.

      _Main-mast._          _Fore-mast._

1 Main-topmast. | 1 Fore-topmast.
1 Main-topsail-yard. | 1 Fore-topsail-yard.
1 Half-yard (rough). | 1 Cross-jack-yard.

_Note._--If you can get other spars, the yards should not be used.

The spars should be placed in the main-deck-ports before and abaft
the masts. When they are placed, the lower-yards, caps, tops and
cross-trees may be sent down and landed.

The shores should then be placed with their heels resting in shoes or
the spare fishes, close out to the water-ways, and their heads between
the trestle-trees before and abaft the mast-heads.

MAST-HEAD SHORES.

    _Main-mast._     _Fore-mast._

1 Main-topmast. | 1 Fore-topmast.
1 Spanker-boom | 1 Jib-boom.

In preference to using belly-shores, I would recommend to fish the
main-mast with the two mizen-topmasts, and the foremast with fore
and main-topgallant-masts; if no other spars are to be had, the
topgallant-studdingsail-booms must be cut up for shores for the decks
and outriggers.

CARPENTERS’ WORK.

In the mean time the carpenters should be employed in shoring the
outriggers and decks under the beams, on which the mast-head-shores
rest: good stages should also be prepared, the spare-shackle or
gammoning-bolts got ready; the copper should be stripped where they are
to be driven, viz.: before, abaft, and between the outriggers, as low
as convenient for driving, and forelocking them on the inside, or as
the water-line will allow.

_Note._--The holes should be bored slanting upwards, so that the
martingales will rather tend to set them in than draw them out; the
shackles or rings of the gammoning-bolts should then be well parceled.

SECURING THE OUTRIGGERS.

In the meantime a party of riggers or seamen should be employed to fit
the martingales and outrigger-shrouds, and to strap the purchase-blocks.

MARTINGALES.

The size of the martingales must depend upon the angle which you are
able to give them, as their size must increase as their angle becomes
less. If the bolts are near the water-line, three parts of eight-inch
for each outrigger will be found sufficient. The main outriggers
should be cleated about eighteen feet from the side, for the rigging.
The heels should be well shored down and securely lashed; they should
also be securely lashed down or gammoned to the breeching-bolts or
scupper-holes, and shored by diagonal shores in the angles of the
port-sills, that the spars in rising may bring an equal pressure on all
parts; otherwise it would probably strain the top sides: the outriggers
should also have a stout lashing to the train-bolts amidships. If the
topsail-yards are used (which is not advisable when other spars can be
obtained), the inner yard-arms must not be allowed to butt the ship’s
side, or water-ways; they should have chain-snotters, and must be
shored in all directions. The fore-outriggers should be cleated about
fifteen feet from the ship’s side, and secured inboard as the main.
In addition to the martingale, the three outriggers for each mast may
be connected by luffs boused well taut, and the stay-tackles may be
used for fore and after-guys, which will bring all to a fair strain.
Any farther security that may suggest itself at the time, according to
circumstances, should not be omitted, as you will never err by being on
the safe side.

STRAPS FOR PURCHASE-BLOCKS.

I would also recommend the straps for the purchase-blocks should be
warped of new, three-inch rope, selvagee-fashion, instead of the large
rope-strap. The upper one will take about two coils, which will give
about twenty-eight parts in the strap. The strap being middled, and the
block seized in, the eyes or legs should pass round the mast-head, and
lash on the same side as the block, and above it, which will give four
times twenty-eight parts of three-inch rope in the neck of the strap.

PIT-BLOCKS.

The length of the lower strap must vary according to the pit you heave
down to. It should contain at least thirty parts of three-inch, and
also have four parts of the strap in the neck. If the pit is deep,
it will be better to warp two separate straps of half the length
for the lower blocks. The same way for the foremast, which may be
securely lashed as most convenient, but neither of the blocks should be
lashed at the mast-head until the outrigger-shrouds are over, set up
hand-taut, and matted over all.

_Note._--A second or preventer-purchase is required to each mast.

PREVENTIVE SHROUDS.[37]

For the main-mast, two lengths of the stream-cable (well parceled) may
next be put over the main-mast-head; these may be set up through the
lower-deck-ports, and kept clear of the channels by short outriggers of
hard wood, with grooves in the outer end to receive the cable resting
in the channels, butting against the ship’s side, and cleated round
the heel, to form a step; the outrigger-shrouds for each mast may then
go over. They should be about eleven-inch-rope; they must be well
parceled: dead-eyes or blocks may be used to set them up, as convenient.

_For further security, the following purchases may be used._

[37] Small sized chain-cable may be used to a good advantage if it
can be obtained.

FOR THE MAIN-MAST,

Two main-top-tackles lashed at the mast-head; one set up at the
main-tack-bolts, the other to the after-quarter-deck-port; two
mast-head-runners to assist the main-stay; two belly-stays of
eleven-inch,[38] lashed one-third down the mast, and set up on the
_weather-side_; two main-yard tackles lashed one-third down; one set up
in the main-tack-bolts, the other, after-quarter-deck-port.

[38] _i. e._, Supposing the vessel to be one of the largest class of
frigates.

FOR THE FORE-MAST.

To assist the lower rigging, two threefold purchases lashed to the
spare chain-plate-bolts; two launches’ purchases lashed to the
mast-head, and set up, one to the cat-head, and the other to the after
part of the fore-chains; two runners lashed at the mast-head; one set
up to the cat-head, one to the chess-tree-bolts; two belly-stays of
eleven inch, one-third way down the mast, and set up half-way in on
the bowsprit; two fore-top-tackles one-third down the mast; one to the
cat-head, one to the chess-tree-water-ways, or scupper-holes, as most
convenient.

THE BOWSPRIT

May be secured by the two fore-yard-tackles, hooked on the weather-side.

THE MIZEN-MAST

May be shored with one shore at the mast-head, and the
mizen-pendant-tackles and burtons may be used to assist the rigging, if
considered necessary.

SETTING UP THE RIGGING.

The wedges being taken out, and the masts drawn over to the opposite
partners, the shores may be cleated and lashed above the rigging,
and below the trestle-trees with good worn rope of three or
three-and-a-half-inch; the lashing should be passed on both, with
racking turns, hove taut by a Spanish windlass, the ends frapped round
all parts, and secured; the heels should also be lashed to the side,
so that they can have no play forward or aft. The outriggers and
martingales being well set up to the span-shackle bolts, and secured
otherwise as before mentioned, the lower rigging and outrigger-shrouds
may be set up to a fair and equal strain, respectively; the
outrigger-shrouds may be a little tauter than the rigging, because
they have a longer drift, and are less strained when offering the same
support; in proportion, the additional purchases may then be set up.

There is one point in the foregoing arrangements that merits peculiar
attention; having once measured the distance between the mast-heads,
and the same between your lower blocks, you must be careful to preserve
the same distance between the mast-heads whenever you may have occasion
to set up afresh; if you neglect this, your mast spreads apart as the
ship comes down, and the stays and rigging are unfairly strained.

The slack of the opposite rigging should then be taken in, and a
swifter should be rove to keep it from hanging in a bight as the ship
goes down.

When the masts are thus secured, the purchase-blocks may be lashed, and
the shores wedged under the heels until they have taken part of the
strain off the rigging. Care should be taken that the shore-heads are
clear of the trestle-trees; the strain should not be wholly upon the
shores and deck, but each shroud and purchase must bear its proportion.

PURCHASE FALLS.

Eleven-inch fall tailed with eight inch, is sufficient for the heaviest
ship in the service. If you have only your own resources, use the large
hawsers tailed with the smaller, or whatever rope is convenient in the
store-room, which may suit the purpose.

_Note._--In reeving, use a small line for that purpose; you will
also save time and trouble by using the capstan[39] in reeving and
overhauling the falls, which is a work of considerable time.

Two-and-a-half-inch stuff is a good size for a reeving line.

[39] If at the wharf or navy-yard, cattle might be clapped on to
reeve the fall with greater facility.

MAST-HEAD STOPPERS.

Two good stoppers of eleven-inch rope should be fitted to each mast;
they may go with a clove-hitch round the mast-head, the ends being long
enough to reeve through the strap of the lower purchase-blocks, to
hitch and seize back; a small jigger, and two balls of spun-yarn should
be ready for each purchase; the leading block should also be lashed
alongside of its respective pit-block with a long lashing, to allow the
leader to rise high enough to clear the fall of the edge of the pit;
and stoppers must also be fitted for each leader-crab or capstan.

The greatest attention is required to the leading of the falls, as the
slightest chafe or rub, with so great a strain, might prove of serious
consequence; a sharp axe should be ready at each pit.

THE PIT.

The formation of the pit, or sleeper, in which your lower block is
secured, must vary so much in locality, that no general rule can be
given.

ANCHORS AND CABLES.

The bowers may be landed, or used to moor the ship with, head
and stern; the sheet-anchors may next be laid out a-beam as
tripping-anchors, at such a distance according to the depth of the
water, as may ensure their holding; one should be abreast of the
foremast, the other opposite the main-mast; a stout hawser should be
bent to the ring of each, and brought in at the second lower-deck port,
abaft the main-mast, and first port abaft the foremast, on the same
side as the anchors are laid out.

The chains to these tripping-anchors should be tailed with a
stream-cable, which is to pass under the ship’s bottom and in at the
quarter-deck port, abaft the main channels and second port on the
forecastle; these ports should be well lined, and stoppers fitted
ready for fleeting; a three-fold purchase stretched across the deck,
may be here applied, so that when you have tripped the ship off by
the hawsers you may bouse the cables in taut, stopper and rack to the
breeching-bolts.

In tripping off, you must be careful to keep the ship parallel to the
pits, or you may chance to bring one anchor home.

[Illustration]

CAULKING, &C.

While the foregoing preparations are being made, the pumps should be
shortened, to work on the lower deck. The caulkers and carpenters
should be employed upon the side that is to be hove down, stopping
the air-holes on all the decks, and thoroughly caulking every seam
or hole that will either be immersed, or exposed to the action
of the water that may find admittance, particularly in the wake
of the hammock-nettings that have been removed, and round the
quarter-galleries.

[Illustration: Arrangement of the Pumps, in heaving down.]

The caulking should be considered a very important point; the smallest
hole that can admit water must be carefully stopped.

The main-deck ports must be filled up in the centre with plank,
well caulked, and covered with tarred canvass; the lower deck ports
and scuttles thoroughly caulked in; the holes for the port-pendants
plugged, cross-caulked, and payed over, and the scuppers made tight
in the same manner; and it must be remembered that want of attention
to these particulars may cost you hours at the pumps, or perhaps
oblige you to right the ship at a moment when you might advantageously
continue the repair; the hawse-holes and stern-ports need not be
stopped, for they will not be near the water when the ship is keel out.

LADDERS, &C.

Battens four inches deep, should be nailed fore and aft on each deck;
knotted ropes and Jacob’s-ladders should be placed at convenient
distances, to secure ready access to every part of the ship, which is
more difficult when she is down than would be imagined.

_Note._--The hatchway ladders should all be lashed.

ARRANGEMENT OF THE PUMPS.

If the water must be raised more than thirty feet, two sets of pumps
will be required; the lower ones must throw the water into tubs or
tanks placed on the lower deck--the upper ones must be placed in these
vessels, and raise it from them to the upper deck; for this purpose
nine or ten pumps will be required; they may be built square, of plank
caulked in the seams, well parceled and woolded, or if timber can be
had, may be formed by sawing straight spars in half lengthwise, and
rejoining them after they are hollowed; then parceling, tarring, and
woolding all over.

The number required being completed, the lower and orlop-decks must be
scuttled, to allow the pumps to be placed at the required angle, so
that their ends may rest a little below the orlop-wing gratings; the
main and upper deck pumps may be sufficiently sloped in the hatchways
with their heels in the vessels, which are raised on platforms inclined
at an angle, to preserve their level when the ship is down.

The pumps should have large holes in their nozzles, and troughs should
be made to carry the water over the skids to leeward on the upper deck.

Substantial platforms must be secured at the same angle, at convenient
positions, for the men to work the pumps.

The pumps should be tried before you heave down, to see that they are
tight, and also when in position to see that the brakes work clear of
the beams and comings.

Any fire engines that can be procured, should be worked in the hold on
similar platforms, with their hoses led on deck.

WEIGHT FOR HEELING AND TRIPPING SHIP.

The rigging being set up, the purchase falls rove, the pumps rigged and
all the foregoing preparations made, fifteen or twenty tons of water
in casks may be placed on the side to be hove down, and lashed to the
breeching-bolts, &c., on the quarter-deck and fore-castle.

PREPARATIONS FOR HEAVING.

The ship may then be hove off by the tripping-hawsers to the distance
of seventy or eighty feet from the pits, and the tripping-cables boused
well taut.

The men required to work the pumps and engines, should be on board,
with a proportion of carpenters to stop small leaks, clear the pumps,
attend the masts in the partners, &c.; the hand-pumps should be used as
long as they will act, so as to keep the ship perfectly dry; the ‘men’
should be to leeward on the upper deck, to assist with their weight the
purchases; at _slack water_ you may commence heaving; the ship will
incline 15° before the slack of the falls is through, and will continue
to close the pits until she is down to 35°; she will then begin to go
off. It must be remembered that the main-mast is to heave the ship
down; the fore purchase is only an assistant, and must not be unfairly
hove upon; avoid surging as much as possible; the moment the pumps will
draw they must begin to work. When the ship is down the falls must
be stoppered and racked, the mast-head stoppers passed, boused taut
and secured; you may then walk back and reverse the falls upon the
capstans, taking a turn round the bitts with the running part, which
is to be hove off by the capstans as you ease up, and will cause less
surging.

STAGES.

Substantial floating stages having been previously made by the
carpenters, should now be ready to haul in; a large boat containing
tool-chests and the stores necessary for stopping the leak, should be
in attendance; when the ship is down, not a single second should be
lost; let your men sing out _cheer_ at the pumps, and forego that part
of your discipline for a short time, which might be a hindrance to your
immediate object. Watch narrowly the purchases and be ready to ease-up
at a moment’s warning, if they slacken or any of the gear carries
away. In easing-up, when the main-deck scuppers are out of water, hold
on, take the lead or canvass off that secured them, and let the water
escape from the deck; you may get rid of several tons thus without much
labor.

The carpenters must be careful in clearing the injured part, not to
increase the leak by undertaking more than they are able to perform;
as a general rule, make all as tight as possible before you think of
easing-up for the night.

=490.=--A DERRICK.

[Illustration]

What is termed a derrick, is a single spar rounded off at the heel to
set in a shoe, (similar to a shear-leg;) the upper end is made with
shoulders or cleats, to stop the purchase-block from working down,
also the guys; the derrick may be used for many purposes instead of
shears to great advantage, especially on board of merchant ships when
discharging, it being so easily swung from a perpendicular position
to rake over the ship’s side, the heel resting in its shoe, and the
head canted in any position by the guys; any kind of a purchase may
be used at a derrick-head, but the most general, is the single and
double-burton.

On the subject of providing means--few ships go to sea without a spare
topmast or a spar to make one, which spar is in every way calculated
for a derrick, if it will make a topmast.

_The rigging_, (that is the various guys and ropes necessary to sustain
it in its position,) and the purchase-blocks for lifting the weight,
may be secured to the spar any height above the deck to suit the
particular purpose in hand, without either cutting the spar, or nailing
on cleats--as by a well managed arrangement of lashings, all slipping
or shifting of position may certainly be prevented.

_Note._--The more a derrick approaches a perpendicular position, the
less will be the strain upon the guys.

GENERAL CAUTIONS.

_In any very intricate Navigation_,

Anchor at night or when in doubt.

Take frequent and short departures.

Pay particular attention that the proper course is steered.

Hand in the chains, and lead kept going.

Good look out.

Anchors ready, and cables clear.

Canvass well regulated and be ready for bringing up.

Boats ready, tackles at hand.

Stream cable and hawsers ready.

Top-gallant-mast-ropes rove.

_Taken in a Squall._

A vigilant look out, will usually prevent your being taken by a squall
in an unprepared state.

If taken in a squall with the wind on the beam, before it, or close
hauled, keep your luff, and lower away, and clew up all as fast as you
can. In doing so the ship will be relieved, and the canvass got in
better than if the helm had been put up.

But if taken in a squall with the wind abaft the beam, putting the helm
up, and running away from it, as well as shortening sail, will then be
the readiest mode of easing a ship. (Remember this.)

_On Good Order--(Merchant Service)._

In a man-of-war, discipline is productive of the greatest good--the
energies of all are called for, and employed as most required; but even
without martial law good regulations might, and ought to be established
in every ship, at all times, and in all places.

The greatest assistance to the promotion of good order, would
be SOBRIETY in seamen. The few shades in the sterling qualities
which belong to them, many of their irregularities and acts of
insubordination, may be traced to intemperance. They might abstain,
perhaps, but they cannot refrain. If owners would give $1 a month in
lieu of spirits, and have a mutual agreement respecting its use abroad,
with a stipulated penalty for drunkenness, ships might be managed much
more safely, and with greater ease and economy than at present; half
the work of discipline would then be effected.

Where the men are sober, have entire confidence in their officers,
and are well treated, not harrassed unnecessarily, and see that the
comforts they ought to have are properly attended to--I think it would
be found in most instances, that effective good order would establish
itself. Where it does exist, the vessel’s services are rendered in
every way more effective and beneficial to her employers, as well as
more agreeable to the officers, crew, and passengers, if any, and her
chances of casualties considerably lessened.

The remedy, too, is in a great measure in the hands of shipowners and
captains themselves; for if they required certificates of sobriety
before they would ship men, drunken ones would either remain unemployed
or become sober,--for even a sober landsman, is more useful than a
drunken sailor.

_On Cleanliness, as regards the Preservation of Life in Vessels._

Nothing is too trifling for an officers attention, that tends to the
health and benefit of those dependent on his care and forethought.

Every vessel should be pumped out _morning_ and _evening_.

A clean, sweet, and dry hold is essential to the health of the crew.

Nothing can be more injurious than for men to sleep over bilge-water,
which must be the case if any water is left in the hold at night.

The hold ought to be cleared often, and when it is, it should be
white-washed; and also the between-decks frequently white-washed.

_On Painting._

In tropical climates, avoid painting as much as possible, particularly
in-board.

_On the Health of Men, in the Merchant Service._

In port, in tropical climates, give the men a little coffee before they
go to work in the morning.

The inconsiderate indulgence in new rum, has been one great means of
increasing the numbers attacked with yellow fever.

Do not allow the men to lay about in night dews; and particularly not
to wait about at wharfs.

Allow the men the use of fresh water whenever it can be spared, for
washing clothes, and also for themselves.

_Rule to find the weight of any sized Rope._--A rope of 1 inch
circumference requires 486 fathoms to make one hundred weight. The
superficial part of all circles being in proportion to the square
of their diameters, consequently the square of their circumference.
Therefore, a rope of 1 inch in circumference, whose square is one,
has 486 fathoms to a cwt.; and, therefore, 486 being divided by the
square of the circumference of any rope, the quotient will give the
number of fathoms. For instance,

9×9 = 81)486(6. The number of fathoms in a cwt.
486
---

_Rule to find the weight of 120 fathoms of any sized
Cable._--Multiply the circumference by the circumference, and divide
the product by 4, and the quotient will be the number of cwts. in 120
fathoms.

The foregoing exhibit of the component parts, &c., of the Navy
Ration, has been compiled in pursuance of the act of Congress, and
will be strictly observed by commanders of vessels and by pursers,
as a regulation of this Department, prescribing the daily issue of
provisions, and the valuation at which they are to be commuted.
All persons “attached to vessels for sea-service,” are entitled
individually to one ration per day.

Every commissioned or warrant-officer, of, or over, twenty-one years of
age, may, at his option, commute the entire ration, or only the spirit
portion of it: provided the commutation, in either case, be made
for not less than three consecutive months. And every other person,
of the above-named age, entitled to a ration, may commute the spirit
component, under the limitation of time, unless sooner detached, or
entitled to a discharge.

No officer or other person, under twenty-one years of age, shall be
permitted to draw the spirit part of his ration. Its value in money,
as estimated by the foregoing table, will be credited to him by the
purser, and paid whenever the commander of the vessel, to which such
officer or person may belong, shall direct.

The messes of a ship’s crew may, with the sanction of the commanding
officer, commute, daily or weekly, one or more entire rations, for
not less than three months (unless sooner detached, or entitled to a
discharge); the commutation to be paid by the purser, at such times as
the said commanding officer shall deem fit.

Pursers having the delivery of rations, will make out and transmit,
monthly and otherwise, by the earliest opportunities, to the Bureau of
Provisions and Clothing of this Department, abstracts of provisions,
agreeably to such forms as may be furnished to them from that bureau,
approved by the Second Comptroller of the Treasury; their provision
accounts, as heretofore, will be rendered to the Fourth Auditor’s
office.

A. P. UPSHUR, _Secretary of the Navy_.

AN ACT TO ESTABLISH AND REGULATE THE NAVY RATION.

SEC. 1. _Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America, in Congress assembled_, That the navy
ration shall consist of the following daily allowance of provisions
for each person:--One pound of salted pork, with half a pint of peas
or beans; or one pound of salted beef, with half a pound of flour, and
a quarter of a pound of raisins, dried apples, or other dried fruits;
or one pound of salt beef, with half a pound of rice, two ounces of
butter, and two ounces of cheese; together with fourteen ounces of
biscuit, one quarter of an ounce of tea, or one ounce of coffee, or one
ounce of cocoa, two ounces of sugar, and one gill of spirits; and of a
weekly allowance of half a pound of pickles or cranberries, half a pint
of molasses, and half a pint of vinegar.

SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That fresh meat may be substituted
for salt beef or pork, and vegetables or sauer-kraut for other articles
usually issued with the salted meats, allowing one and a quarter pounds
of fresh meat for one pound of salted beef or pork, and regulating the
quantity of vegetables or sauer-kraut, so as to equal the value of
those articles for which they may be substituted.

SEC. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That, should it be necessary
to vary the above described daily allowance, it shall be lawful to
substitute one pound of soft bread, or one pound of flour, or half a
pound of rice, for fourteen ounces of biscuit; half a pint of wine
for a gill of spirits; half a pound of rice for half a pint of peas
or beans; half a pint of beans or peas for half a pound of rice. When
it may be deemed expedient by the President of the United States,
Secretary of the Navy, commander of a fleet or squadron, or a single
ship, when not acting under the authority of another officer on foreign
service, the articles of butter, cheese, raisins, dried apples (or
other dried fruits), pickles and molasses may be substituted for each
other and for spirits; _provided_ the article substituted shall not
exceed in value the article for which it may be issued, according to
the scale of prices which is or may be established for the same.

SEC. 4. _And be it further enacted_, That in cases of necessity the
daily allowance of provisions may be diminished or varied, by the
discretion of the senior officer present in command; but payment shall
be made to the persons whose allowance shall be thus diminished,
according to the scale of prices which is or may be established for the
same; but a commander, who shall thus make a diminution or variation,
shall report to his commanding officer, or to the Navy Department,
the necessity for the same, and give to the purser written orders,
specifying particularly the diminution or reduction which is to be made.

SEC. 5. _And be it further enacted_, That no commissioned officer,
or midshipman, or any person under twenty-one years of age, shall be
allowed to draw the spirit part of the daily ration; and all other
persons shall be permitted to relinquish that part of their ration,
under such restrictions as the President of the United States may
authorize; and to every person who, by this section, is prohibited
from drawing, or who may relinquish, the spirit part of his ration,
there shall be paid, in lieu thereof, the value of the same in money,
according to the prices which are or may be established for the same.

SEC. 6. _And be it further enacted_, That the provisions of this act
shall go into effect, in the United States, on the first day of the
succeeding quarter after it becomes a law; and in vessels abroad, on
the first day of the succeeding quarter after its official receipt; and
any acts, or parts of acts, which may be contrary to, or inconsistent
with, the provisions of this act, shall be and are hereby repealed.

The Table is to be entered with the number of points contained between
the ships head and the _first_ bearing of the object, at the top, and
with the number of points, reckoned the same way, between the ship’s
head and the _second_ bearing, at the side; the number in the table at
the intersection of the two columns being multiplied by the distance
run, is the distance from the object at the time the _last_ bearing was
taken.

EXAMPLE.--A Light-house bears N. W., and after running W. by S. 8
miles, it bears N. N. E.; the number of points between W. by S. and
N. W. is 5, and that between W. by S. and N. N. E. is 11; then under
5 points at the top, and abreast of 11 points at the side, stands the
number 0.9, which being multiplied by 8 gives 7.2 miles, the distance
at the time of the last (N. N. E.) bearing.

If the bearings are observed to quarter points, the numbers may be
taken out accordingly; this needs no example.

All boat’s bottoms are to be boarded with cypress and to be
copper-fastened; their stem and stern plates are also to be made of
copper.

Gigs, Barges, Waist and Quarter-boats are to have copper knees.

Launches, First and Second Cutters, for three-deck ships, are to be
fitted without knees; the clamps are to be made sufficiently strong
for the athwart bolts to pass through them and forelock; the ends of
the athwarts are to be fitted with iron plates.

Launches and First Cutters for Ships of the Line of two decks,
Razees, Frigates, and first-class Sloops of War, and Launches for
second and third class Sloops, Steamers, Brigs and Brigantines, are
to be fitted as the Launches for three-deck ships.

All Launches are to be coppered.

Barges, Gigs, Whale-boats and Cutters are to be fitted with
composition row-locks.

Schooners’ Launches will be of the size allowed to Brigs, when the
breadth of beam and deck arrangements will permit.

Second class Steamers’ Launches and First Cutters will be of the size
allowed to second class Sloops of War, when these will stow to better
advantage than those designated.

In fitting the dead wood and aprons of boats that stow in nests,
boat-builders will see that no unnecessary wood is used about them,
and that the keels are reduced forward and aft, to make the bottom of
keel convex, so that the boats may be stowed as low as possible.

All boats are to have two ring-bolts through their stem and stern
posts; the lower bolts to be from nine to twelve inches below the
upper ones, with an oblong ring to be of the same height as the upper
ones when they are both turned up; and all Launches are to be fitted
with a ring-bolt one-fifth from each end, and another amid-ships down
through the keel, to be well clinched on the outside.

Rollers forward and aft in all First Launches, are to be of length
sufficient to take the chain of their respective ships; the rollers
of Second Launches are to be five inches in length.

The timbers of Second Launches are to be one-third larger than those
of First Cutters of the old class, and the rest of the materials are
to be in like proportion to make a light Launch.

All Launches are to be fitted with wells and self-fleeting windlasses
amid-ships, for weighing anchors.

All Whale-boats are to be lap-streaked, or clinker-built.

RECIPES.

=527.=--FOR BLACKING SHIP’S STANDING-RIGGING.

To a half barrel of tar add 6 gallons of whiskey, 4 pounds of litharge,
4 pounds lamp-black, 2 buckets of boiling beef-pickle, or hot salt
water out of the coppers, if the other cannot be had conveniently; mix
well together and apply immediately.

=528.=--FOR BLACKING GUNS.

Six pound of beeswax mixed with one gallon of spirits of turpentine,
one paper of lamp-black, mixed well together, for twenty 24 pounders.

_Note._--The beeswax to be cut fine, and dissolved in spirits of
turpentine before being mixed with the lamp-black.

=529.=--FOR BLACKING HAMMOCK-CLOTHS, YARDS, AND BENDS.

First scrub the cloth well with salt water, and while wet put on the
first coat of priming, which should be well-ground paint, with one
and-a-half pounds of beeswax added to each gallon of paint; after the
first coat is dry, put on second, mixed as follows, viz.: one pound
lamp-black mixed for paint, one pound red lead, one gallon paint oil,
half pound litharge, and half an ounce of indigo, boiled for half
an hour, and stirred at intervals. Care should be taken that the
composition boils that length of time. After it has cooled a little,
add one pint of spirits of turpentine; apply when warm, and it will
dry in a short time with a beautiful gloss, and be perfectly limber.
This last mixture has been found very suitable for yards, and also the
bends; but it must never be used too warm, particularly on canvass, in
which case it will lose its gloss. The priming, or first coat, is not
put on cloths that have been blacked before.

=530.=--FOR MAKING LIQUID-BLACKING.

Four ounces of ivory black, five or six table-spoonsful of molasses,
one and a-half ounce oil of vitriol, one and a-half ounce sweet oil,
and six gills of vinegar. After mixing the ingredients together well
and stirring them frequently, the blacking will be fit for use.

=531.=--FOR BLACKING GUNS.

Six ounces of lamp-black, three pints of spirits of turpentine,
and three ounces of litharge to be put in after the lamp-black and
turpentine are well mixed; add one ounce of umber to give it a gloss,
and one gallon bright varnish.

=532.=--COMPOSITION FOR BLACKING GUNS.

Six pounds of beeswax cut up fine, then add seven quarts spirits of
turpentine; let it stand until it is well dissolved, then add one pound
lamp-black, and mix it well together.

=533.=--FOR MAKING BLACK-VARNISH, NO. I.

Two pounds of gum shellac, two pounds umber, one gallon linseed oil,
and quarter pound of lamp-black; boiled together for four hours over a
slow fire.

=534.=--COMPOSITION FOR BLACKING HAMMOCK CLOTHS, NO. I.

Twenty pounds of beeswax, four pounds rosin, two gallons spirits of
turpentine, one gallon paint oil, and six pound of lamp-black. Boil
them well together, and keep it warm while putting on.

_Note._--To be primed first with lead-colored paint.

=535.=--COMPOSITION FOR HAMMOCK CLOTHS, NO. II.

Forty-eight pounds of yellow ochre, eight pounds black paint, half
pound soap, and three pints of fresh water.

=536.=--FOR HAMMOCK CLOTHS, NO. III.

Half a pound of black paint, three pounds yellow ochre, half pound of
soap, three-quarters of a gill of fresh water.

=537.=--FOR HAMMOCK CLOTHS, NO. IV.

Eighty pounds black paint well ground, ten gallons linseed oil, ten
pounds of beeswax, five pounds litharge, and one gallon of spirits of
turpentine. For blacking bends, add two gallons of tar.

=538.=--FOR MAKING BLACK-VARNISH, NO. II.

One gallon of the spirits of turpentine, one pound and four ounces of
rosin, one pound and four ounces lamp-black, and one quart of linseed
oil; to be boiled on a slow fire for half-an-hour, then used or laid on
when cold.

=539.=--SOLDER FOR COPPER.

Nothing is necessary here, but good tough borax and brass, well mixed
together with water, to the consistence of paste.

=540.=--SOLDER FOR LEAD.

Take two parts of water-lead, and one part of tin; its goodness is
tried by melting it, and pouring the size of a half dollar piece on a
table; then if it be good there will arise small, bright stars or beads
on it. Apply rosin when you use it.

=541.=--TO MAKE THE BEST DRYING OIL.

Mix one pound of litharge of gold to every six gallons of oil; boil it
over a slow fire, but not too much, least it prove too thick, and be
unserviceable.

=542.=--FOR BLACK STAIN.

Four ounces of copperas; iron rust, or a few pieces of old iron hoop;
one gallon of vinegar; half pound lamp-black, and a small quantity of
oak shavings.

=543.=--BLACKING GUNS, SHOT, &c.

Coal tar alone, or mixed with a little salt water, is a good thing for
blacking guns and shot. It should be laid on quite warm, and if the day
be cold, a hot shot may with advantage be put into the guns to warm
the metal, and make it take the blacking better, due attention being
previously paid to unloading.

Lay the stuff on as thin as possible, with paint-brushes, using hot
loggerheads or bolts to keep it warm.

If well laid on, and wiped afterwards with an oil-cloth occasionally,
this process will prevent rust, and preserve the good look of the guns
for a length of time, without having recourse to washing with water.

=544.=--FRENCH RECIPE FOR BLACKING GUNS, &c.

To one gallon of vinegar, put ten ounces of lamp-black, and one pound
and a-half of clear sifted iron-rust, and mix them well together.

Lay this on the guns after a good coat of black paint, and rub it
occasionally with a soft oil-cloth.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

From the Sailor’s Magazine.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT: _second edition,
improved and enlarged with additional matter, illustrated with
seventy engravings, and tables, 8vo., pp. 420_. By WILLIAM BRADY,
_Sailing Master_, _U. S. Navy_; _reviewed by a Master Mariner_.

This is a work very much needed for the younger members of our
profession, being the most complete thing of the kind that has ever
been published. There is nothing of the smallest moment in use on board
a man-of-war, or merchantman, but it has illustrated in a plate, and
its use or uses fully described. With singular faithfulness it details
the whole minutiæ of ship’s duty, from the knotting of ropeyarns
to splicing heavy cables and fitting standing rigging. It not only
embraces all the particulars of the rigging work, but explains with
equal clearness the various mechanical operations necessarily combined
to fit out a first class ship. Here the novice may acquire a great deal
by practising from the various plates and figures, while preparing for
a nautical life; besides, from its fullness on those subjects the most
interesting to the young sailor, it will be calculated to lead him to
study his Manual, and thereby not entirely lose all relish for study,
when first embarking in his ocean life, which has hitherto been so
common and so disadvantageous to young men. There is no kind of duty on
ship-board but is here explained, and I conceive it the most valuable
work not only for novices, but for every grade in our profession.
There is a great deal of very useful information for all, however
experienced they may be. Every kind of spar is described, with its
relative proportions and use--the rules for which few men can carry in
their minds. And it is quite important to know, in masting and sparring
a ship, what are the principles which govern the usage of the day, even
if we alter the proportions afterward to suit our own caprice or fancy.

The author has clearly shown himself to be master of his business;
he has described fully all the various parts of the ship’s hull and
spars--the different pieces of standing and running rigging, with the
way to fit the one and how to cut and reeve the other. He teaches how
to get the masts and yards on board, aloft, and rigged--he speaks
of all with sufficient clearness, and at the same time does not
unnecessarily multiply words. After rigging and sparring the ship, he
bends the sails, after the most judicious plan in fitting out for sea,
or when blown away or split in a storm--and after putting the ship to
sea, as it were, he then, in a seamanlike manner, explains all the
various evolutions through which a ship may be passed, and supposes
almost every extremity to which a ship is liable, giving the modern,
and I might add, profitably improved method of doing things: for it is
well known, that during the last 30 years there have been very many and
equally great improvements in the method of rigging as well as working
sea-going ships.

I observe the author explains, in such places as have been deemed
necessary, the different methods in use on board heavy-armed ships and
merchantmen, which makes the book the more valuable to both classes
of the service. Mr. Brady has some capital and useful remarks on the
subject of the barometer, some of which I found entirely new to myself,
although having used one for the last twenty years. But I conceive that
his tables are very valuable even to shipmasters. Instead of lumbering
up this book with what in fact belongs to an epitome of navigation,
as has been the practice generally hitherto, he has confined himself,
strictly speaking, to only those subjects which would naturally occur
to one as coming under the head of seamanship--or, in other words, he
has compiled literally “a Sailor’s Assistant.” I confidently assert,
I have never seen the same amount of really useful and practical
information in the same space adapted to our profession before. Here we
find enumerated for the various classes of vessels, according to their
tonnage, the requisite number of anchors, cables, guns, carriages,
shot, &c., with their size, weight, and the comparative strength of
the cables and rigging both chain and hemp: also a variety of most
useful intelligence, and which must have been elicited only after
considerable practical experiment--all of the most interesting as well
as useful importance, not only to the novice, but the officer--the
master--and I would even confidently add, that there is a great deal
of information contained in this work which would make it a valuable
acquisition to every ship-owner’s counting-room. There is nothing put
on board the various classes of ships, but is described in the book,
first to tell how it is made, and how it is rigged--how it is taken
on board (if heavy)--its weight, and the amount allowed according to
the length of the cruise. Nothing is omitted. I conceive that every
ship-owner would find it an acquisition as a counting-house companion,
as well as a “Young Sailor’s Assistant.” His recipes, which I find at
the termination of the book, are not without their value; and although
simple in themselves, yet not generally known.

I cannot close without saying a few words in relation to the very
judicious remarks he has made under the head of “good order” (merchant
service) and cleanliness. It is undeniable that temperance and
cleanliness would add much to the health, comfort, and good order of
a crew; but it must be allowed that comparatively little has been
done for the sailor--much more must be done before he will be made to
realize the terrible effects of intemperance and licentiousness upon
both body and soul, for time and eternity. It is cheering to see that
spirits have been banished from the list of small stores on board
of respectable American ships: and we can but hope that, ere long,
through the influence of the efforts that are being made, especially
for seamen, among several denominations of Christians in this city--by
their building handsome churches on shore and afloat--splendid Homes
which are made to them homes indeed when they resort to them--by
their donations of books and libraries adapted to their characters
and profession--that a few years will see them a different and vastly
improved class of men. Already do we begin to see the influence of the
leaven that has been cast among them, which leads us to the conviction
that there is a better time coming for the sailor; and we cannot but
hope and trust that all ranks of Christians will be diligent in prayer
to God that “the abundance of the sea may be speedily converted unto
him.” Finally, with the author I also think it entirely unnecessary for
him to offer any apology in sending this work abroad to the public. If
I may be allowed to offer an opinion on the merits of the composition
or its style, I must say I have come to the conclusion, in the absence
of any other guide but this book, being an utter stranger to the
author, that he is--he _must be_--a seaman--a scholar--and a gentleman.
I observe he professes, as his motto, “Hope for his anchor, and Heaven
for his guide,” and I fervently pray that neither the one nor the other
may ever fail him.

From the Literary World.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT. By WM. BRADY,
_Sailing Master_, _U. S. N._ Published by the Author.

Nowadays, when all science, arts, and callings are delineated in
books, and the pen is wielded by members of every profession, it is no
marvel that an excellently planned work, upon all things pertaining to
seamanship, should be presented to the public by a gentleman of the
marline-spike. And albeit the author tells us that that instrument is
to him more familiar than the pen, he has, nevertheless, shown himself
quite expert with the latter.

“The Kedge Anchor” (a happy title, at least to Jack) has already run
through one edition, which, for a purely practical work, is the best
evidence of its merits. The present edition is, in many respects, an
improvement upon the former, containing additional matter, plates and
tables. To a sailor this work is invaluable; indeed, it is by far the
best of the sort we ever remember to have seen. Generally, works of
this description are loosely and carelessly put together; to use a
nautical phrase, they are by no means “ship-shape and Bristol fashion,”
and, in many cases, are mere servile copies, or abridgments of obsolete
books on the same subject. The sailor-poet’s (Falconer) Marine
Dictionary, published many years ago, has been the source from which
most of them have been compiled. But in seamanship, as in everything
else, great improvements and changes have, from time to time, been
effected, and Mr. Brady’s volume contains them all. We cordially
commend his book to all the purchasers of Bowditch’s Navigation;
and we will furthermore guaranty that he who masters both, will be
fully qualified to conduct a vessel round the globe with unerring
certainty--enter a harbor as unexceptionably and gracefully as ever
Brummel did a drawing-room, and cockbill his yards at a symmetrical
angle.

Not only to seamen, but to many landsmen, the “Kedge Anchor” cannot
fail to be an acceptable volume. Its copious dictionary of sea terms,
its excellent illustrations of nautical manœuvres and the information
imparted upon all things pertaining to the construction, rig, and
appointment of the ships in our navy, make the book truly valuable.
From the “gammoning” of a bowsprit, and the staying of a royal-mast, to
the taking of a “bowline-in-the-bight,” the student in tar will find
all the information he can desire.

The book is well got up, contains numerous well-executed cuts, and is
alike creditable to author and publisher. We specially commend it to
the members of the Yacht Club, as a _vade mecum_ for blue water.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT. By WILLIAM BRADY, _S.
M._, _U. S. N._

This work, as its title imports, is designed as an assistant for the
young Sailor, through the various branches of his arduous profession.
It contains useful instructions in every department of seamanship, with
ample directions, which will impart to the young officer a great deal
of valuable information in the duties of his profession, and enable him
to act in the most judicious manner in many trying emergencies.

In addition to many suggestions, which will prove valuable to every
grade of seamen, it contains more thorough descriptions of the
innumerable articles belonging to the various classes of vessels, than
any other work ever published in this country; and is embellished with
over seventy engravings, in illustration of the subjects treated of
in its pages. The work is furnished with over one hundred pages of
tables, which are valuable not only to the sea-faring man, but to all
who are in any way interested in maritime pursuits. The entire work is
contained in a volume of 420 pages, octavo, stereotype edition. It is
printed on fine paper, and bound in handsome style. For sale by R. L.
Shaw, No. 222 Water street, N. Y.

From the True Sun.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT.

We have had for several days lying on our table a massive octavo volume
of some 420 pages, of which we have given the title. The author of it
is William Brady, S. M., U. S. N., and it is on sale at the Sailor’s
Home, and by most of the nautical stationers. The whole science of
seamanship appears to be included in this fine volume, from the
coiling of a rope to the dissection of a man-of-war and every nautical
appendage thereof. No jot or tittle of a seaman’s duty appears to have
been overlooked; everything is explained, and the most intricate things
illustrated by engravings. The entire typographical execution and
material of the volume are excellent; we do not find the price attached
to it; but to the seaman--to the young seaman particularly--it must be
invaluable.

From the New York Courier & Enquirer.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT, _&c._, _&c._,
_illustrated with seventy engravings_. By WM. BRADY, _S. M._, _U. S.
N._ _2d edition, enlarged and improved_. New York.

This is a handsome and no doubt a useful handbook for the young sailor
or officer, explaining as it does, and illustrating by handsome cuts
the various manipulations of the Sailor’s craft.

The instruction comprehends the whole of the duties of the sailor, as
well as regards the practical evolutions of the vessel, as the various
details connected with rigging the vessel.

The volume has already gone through one edition, which is presumptive
evidence of its merits--and we dare say there will be ample demand for
this second edition.

From the Long Island Star.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT.

We have just received the second edition of a very neat work, entitled
“The Kedge Anchor,” improved and enlarged, with additional matter,
plates, and tables, by Mr. William Brady, and dedicated to the United
States Navy and Merchant Service.

It is very neatly bound and good print, and is intended to instruct
“Young Seamen” in rigging, knotting, splicing, blocks, purchases, and
other miscellaneous matter applicable to vessels and ships of war.
It is illustrated with seventy engravings, also a great number of
Tables useful to seamen. It is also printed on beautiful paper, and it
instructs you to build vessels of war.

Published at New York by Mr. Wm. Brady, and sold at R. L. Shaw’s
Nautical Store, 222 Water street, N. Y.

It is octavo size, 420 pages, and handsomely illustrated with fine
wood-cuts, representing many of the most beautifully modeled vessels in
the U. S. Navy. It is a work of much labor and expense, and should be
in the possession of every seaman, more especially those of the Navy. A
copy of the work may be seen at this office.

From the New York Sunday Dispatch.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT.

The extraordinary demand for the above meritorious work has, in a very
short time, exhausted the first edition.

The author, William Brady, a sailing master in the United States Navy,
has published a second edition, with additional tables and somewhat
improved in typographical beauty. It is useless for us to speak of its
merits as a text-book for the young officer. It is most emphatically a
work of great merit, and one which will commend _itself_ to all classes
whose “march is o’er the mountain wave.” The remarks it contains on
that invaluable instrument the Barometer, are correct, and will do much
to destroy the unfounded prejudice which some have against it.

The volume contains a great number of plates, neatly executed, which
serve to illustrate with precision a variety of nautical evolutions.
The precautions for scudding are worthy of attention. It is a
well-known fact among _sailors_ that many a good ship has been boarded
by a sea, while scudding under _short sail_, when the disaster might
easily have been avoided by showing more canvas. The work contains
all the tables necessary for sparring and rigging a ship, and that in
so plain and practical a manner that we cannot see how it is possible
for any one to make a mistake; on the whole, we are inclined to think,
that, though the author modestly calls it a _Kedge Anchor_, there is
many an old salt who will look upon it as his _best bower_.

From the New York Express.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR. By WILLIAM BRADY, _U. S. N._

This is the title of a very handsome volume, professing to give
thorough descriptions of the almost innumerable equipments belonging to
the various classes of vessels. We are not “old salt” enough to speak
as to the accuracy of its teachings, but it seems to be very complete
and intelligible; and is illustrated with drawings of more ways of
doing things than any but a sailor would ever dream of.

From the Brooklyn Daily Advertiser.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT--is the title of a
work just published by William Brady, Sailing Master in the U. S.
Navy. Mr. Brady is a thorough seaman and eminently qualified to the
task he has here undertaken. Every information is given appertaining
to the practical evolutions of modern seamanship--rigging, knotting,
splicing, blocks, purchases, running rigging, and other miscellaneous
matters, applicable to ships of war and others. Illustrated with
several engravings. Also tables of rigging, spars, sails, blocks,
canvas, cordage, chain and hemp-cables, hawsers, &c., relative to every
class of vessels. To those who are about to become sailors, the Kedge
Anchor is invaluable; and those who have followed the sea, no matter
how long, may derive information therefrom. It should be on board every
vessel and in every library, as much may be found to interest even
the landsman. The work meets the approval of the most able commanders
in the merchant and naval service. The author is now attached to the
Brooklyn Navy Yard, holding the appointment of Sailing Master, and is
known as one of the best practiced seamen in the navy.

From the New York Sun.

THE KEDGE ANCHOR; or, YOUNG SAILOR’S ASSISTANT. By WM. BRADY, _S.
M._, _U. S. N._, second edition. R. L. Shaw, 222 Water street. This
is decidedly the best work for the maritime community, and the best
adapted to convey perfect instruction to all who desire to learn the
profession of seamanship, that we have ever seen. It has reached a
second edition, and deserves to reach twenty, as it no doubt will. We
shall have more to say respecting this valuable work; and in the mean
time it should find a place in every library and on board every ship.

Transcriber’s Notes

Depending on the hard- and software used to read this text and
on their settings, not all elements may display as intended. The
(larger) tables towards the end of this text have been split into
narrower chunks in such a way (full length, horizontal chunks from
left to right) that they may easily be recombined to their full
width. Several tables might be considered continuations of the
foregoing table(s). Due to the order in which they were printed and
differences in lay-out they have been included here as separate
tables.

Page numbers 211 and 212 are not used in the source document, the
pagination jumps directly from 210 to 213.

Except as mentioned under Changes below, the text in this e-text is
that of the source document, including archaic, obsolete, unusual
and inconsistent spelling (also of proper names), hyphenation and
grammar. Repeated illustrations (including those that appear to
be ornamental only) and text have not been deleted. Differences in
wording between the Table of Contents and the section titles have not
been standardised.

Table data and calculations have not been checked or corrected,
except as listed below. Several tables towards the end of the book
that were printed on separate pages in the source document have
been recombined when their contents and lay-out suggested they were
intended to be read as single tables. Many of the tables give no
units for lengths etc.

The author often uses full stops between feet and inches (so 2 feet
10 inches may be written 2.10), and between tons, hundredweights,
quarters and pounds (as in 1.13.1.24), etc. which may resemble but
are not decimal points.

References to tables: unless the context or the reference itself make
it clear which of the tables is intended, reference is assumed to be
made to the part of the book containing all of the tables in general.

Page 31, ... which has been described before on another page: it is
unclear to which other page this refers.

Page 53, footnote [3]: this footnote also refers to the very section
where it is included.

Page 148, 28, 4.17 seconds: as printed in the source document,
including the comma and period, the spacing and the values.

Page 281, (See Pudding.): there is no such entry in the word list,
but the subject is discussed in several places in the body text.

Page 293, Table 499: the value 2¹⁄₄ in column Size is possibly an
error for 2¹⁄₂.

Page 314. Columns Frigates and Smaller of sub-category Receiving
Vessels: it is not clear from the source document which ranks are
included in the phrase By special order.

Page 318, Table 517, row Mizen Royal Yard, values 11 (in this
context: .11 inch) in columns Masthead: possibly error for 1 1 (in
this context: 1 foot 1 inch) (2×).

Page 344: the two entries here included as ??? were illegible in the
source document.

Page 384: Table 525, row Size of Spar-deck Beam: 10 is possibly an
error for 1.0.

Changes made:

Multi-page tables from the original have been re-combined into
single tables; in those cases repeated table and column headers have
been deleted, as have connecting elements like Brought and Carried
forward. Ditto marks and do. in some tables have been replaced with
the dittoed text.

Plates and illustrations have been moved outside text paragraphs.
Footnotes were moved to underneath the sections or tables to which
they belong. Some plates and individual illustrations have been
rotated.

Obviously missing or erroneous punctuation was added or otherwise
corrected silently. Obvious minor misprints and typographical errors
have been corrected silently as well.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
